REVIEWS:

->Nathan's apartment is spacious and clean. There are two bedrooms with double beds (although a bit small for tall Dutch people). There is a large kitchen and a good size living room. <br/>There is a little garden, at the time when we were here the landscaping was not quite finished yet.<br/>There is ample parking on the street, free of cost in the evenings and weekends.<br/>Public transport to the center of London is a bit more of a challenge. There is a train station in Loughborough and apparently a bus hub somewhere in the area but there was no info in the apartment about the connections (Nathan told us he will see to that soon).<br/>In the morning planes fly over so earplugs are a must.
->Nathan's place was a bit confusing at first from the photos. We went to the wrong house on the street however, it is the building on your right. The pictures shown were a bit misleading. The shower looks much larger in the photos, the kitchen wasn't up to my standards, and the apt looks like a quick refurbished job. You can make it work if you are there for a few days. Overall it was an ok night's rest
->Thanks Nathan. Nice clean spot. slightly difficult to find.... once we figured out the bus at the end of the Road access was much easier. <br/>Nathan left tea and coffeeand some milk for us do that was great. we were a family of 6 . Hot water for showers was great. would come again.
->Nathan was an attentive host - great communication and was quick to help with any queries.
->The place is nice and clean and the location is close to many trains and buses which I enjoyed . This place is mostly for short stays and the rooms are very spacious . The bathroom is incredibly small and the drainage is poor so you have to take quick showers. I love that the toilet and shower are in two different spots so no hogging the bathroom when you really gotta go. The sink over the toilet was weird but efficient . When I arrived we sadly had no heat and hot water, was not something you want to experience after flying in early only having to wait hours to check in. But Nathan is very responsive and fixed the issue for us  quickly and even left a bottle oh Hennessy which was very nice of him. The shower head in the bathroom was close to falling of so we were afraid to touch it and be blamed for damages …the place could use some remodeling and more art pieces on the wall to make it more homely. On Sunday their was a church or event gathering which made lots of noise in the morning but I didn’t mind because I know Africans love a celebration lol . (Just something to be wary of ) overall I enjoy the stay and enjoy Nathan’s quick fix and communication . I would most likely stay again if the prices were a little cheaper but overall I enjoyed my stay as I was mostly experiencing london . Thank you Nathan !
->Had a great stay in London. <br/>The place reflects the images in the listing well.<br/>Nathan’s flat was clean, cozy,with quick access to transport and convenience stores nearby.<br/>Communication with the host was perfect, replying almost instantly to any query.<br/>Overall, really enjoyed my time there and would definitely come back in the near future.
->Nathan was really easy to communicate with and was really helpful if we had any issues.
->Nice apartment!
->The flat was clean and had everything we needed. Great for a few days.
->Great stay for the price.  Public transportation everywhere. The place is A little outside of the sites in London, but you can get to them just fine.

->Ubicación estupenda cerca de las atracciones principales y bien comunicada tanto por metro como por bus.<br/>Limpieza y amplitud del apartamento sumado a la comodidad y que no le falta de nada, han conseguido que nos sintamos en nuestra propia casa. Cama cómoda. Baños fantásticos. Cocina equipada. Wifi funciona muy bien. Muy tranquilo para descansar por las noches. Los propietarios atentos y accesibles. Recomendaría a mis amigos y familia o cualquier persona que quiera disfrutar Londres.
->we had a great time. hosts or their team was available for every question with fast response time. location was unique 15 minutes walk from Thames, 5 min to underground yet a very quiet neighborhood.<br/>apartment itself is very spacious, bedrooms and bathroom were very big and modern. <br/>living room and rooms have big windows,  terraces enablin a lot of sun.
->This is a great flat in the city - beautifully appointed. Inflatable bed was a bit odd as it was in the master bedroom....but I would highly recommend the flat.
->Good place to stay in London 
->David and Paul’s home is beautiful and a real joy for your stay in London. Tons of nearby buses, tubes and taxis, plus an easy 30 min walk to the London Eye and the Thames. The bedrooms are spacious and the leafy outlook is super relaxing after a hard day of sightseeing. The hosts are really responsive with any queries and gave us good advise about getting around in London. Good wifi too. The stairs between the two floors of the home are quite steep and can be tough on the knees (we had all just done the West Highland Way so our knees were knackered!) but other than hat we loved our stay. Highly recommended. 
->Great stay at David's apartment. Accurate pictures and description. Bedrooms are on separate floors, which provides an additional level of privacy.  If you are looking for the freezer, the modern kitchen has it tucked away separately under the counter. For coffee drinkers the options are french press, vintage-style stovetop percolator, or instant. Air conditioners are located in each bedroom and sufficiently cooled the apartment when it was 80F outside. <br/>It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the tube. However, uber rides to Greater London were 6-10 GBP and was an easier door-to-door travel option. It's also less costly if you are traveling with a family or group. A number of restaurants, take away, and grocery options within a 5-10 minute walk. Neighborhood is residential and safe.<br/>One thing to note is that the google street view didn't match the modern look of the apartment. David's apartment can't be seen on the google street view because it's through the black gate, which opens to a nice private courtyard prior to accessing the apartment in the back.
->No service at all !!! But first class apartment at good calm location, you will find everything that you need for your stay in the apartment.<br/>One bedroom has air mattress which is comfortable though.<br/>No service is regarding an issue we faced with check in which was promised at 3:00 pm but instead it was ready by 8:00 pm only as we had to stay there for the cleaner to clean it up and our whole first day got wasted and we were provided with bath towels set 1 peice for each guest and we were promised the first day that we will be provided with new towel set 1 peice for each guest and were given the same assurance for 6 days but no towels reached out to us so the third day we bought new towels any ways.<br/>They charge about 50£ for late check out but what about late check in they should compensate too.<br/>PS :- Lovely apartment highly recommend but beware of services provided by the team.
->We had a nice stay in the appartment. <br/>Perfect location, great house!<br/>Contact with Paul was good and he helped use perfect.

REVIEWS:

->The property is newly renovated with 2 double beds bedrooms.  Although the living is not big, there was Flat TV with Netflix ready.  The kitchen is fully equipped and provided with coffee machine, tea bags and snacks.  The only problem we have is the premise is located on the 4 storey which means there are stairs to climb, so make sure you don’t have large and heavy luggages or you are strong to carried them all the way up.
->The apartment had modern interior and was very clean. Beautiful view and was a great space for 3 people. Everything we needed was provided and Niyi answered within the hour even minutes. Only one thing we missed was air conditioning having in mind that it was a hot summer week.
->This place was great, especially for the price! Very clean and neat.
->This is an extremely clean and comfortable flat. We felt very safe and the public transport into London was easy to manage. Great value for money for up to 5 people.

->Logement très propre et très bien équipé. 2 belles et grandes chambres. Séjour agréable avec son petit balcon avec vue sur les gratte-ciels londoniens. C'est très calme et bien isolé. Le quartier n'est pas particulièrement joli mais pas de problème de sécurité. En plus, on est en 30 minutes en bus des principaux monuments de Londres.Nous avons laissé notre voiture immatriculée en France pendant 4 jours dans la rue sans problème. Bref, c'est très agréable et un bon rapport qualité prix ! Merci encore pour cet agréable séjour
->Lovely apartment and excellent communication with Niyi. Easy commute into central London with buses and using the tube. Would happily stay again
->We enjoyed our stay at the apartment. In a  20/30 minutes bus ride you're at the main tourist attractions in London. The apartment was big and all the facilities where clean. We recommend staying here!

->I️ stayed here for 6 weeks.  This place is very well equipped, as I️ wanted for nothing the entire stay. It literally looks like what you see in the photos and is as fantastic as you might imagine. Far more spacious than what I’m accustomed to encountering in London. Elephant & Castle is a short 15 minute walk which was excellent for my commute.
->Siamo stati ospiti una settimana a Natale. L'appartamento è  davvero accogliente e confortevole, molto luminoso, con ampie vetrate schermate da tende; gli spazi ben arredati e ampi, esattamente come si vede dalle foto. La cucina è  attrezzata con lavastoviglie, frigo e congelatore, abbiamo cucinato comodamente la nostra cena di Natale. La zona è tranquilla, silenziosa e comoda da raggiungere, a 10 minuti da bus e metropolitana. Ci siamo trovati davvero bene!
->Great place! Loved it!
->This is a modern, clean and beautiful one-bed apartment which had ample space for our family of four. We loved having a full kitchen and laundry for our stay, and the location was a short walk to the Elephant & Castle tube station and multiple bus options. Communication was easy and quick and Catherine was a great host. <br/>Would highly recommend this apartment and we would definitely stay there again if returning to London.
->Il n'y a pas un seul instant ou j'ai regretté ce logement. C'est un appartement magnifique, confortable et reposant. J'ai invité mes parent d'un certains âge à séjourner dans ce charmant appartement facile d'accès convient même aux personnes handicapées ou d'un certains âge comme mes parent. Catherine est d'une gentillesse extrême et répond d'une rapiditée a vos questions ce qui a facilité mes recherches. Elle sait comment recevoir ses invités et prévoir à l'avance le nécessaire pour que l'on manque de rien c'était un réel plaisir de l'avoir comme partenaire je n'ai malheureusement pas eu la chance de la rencontrer mais le monsieur qui m'a gentillement fait visiter les lieux était d'une extrême bonté. Je souhaite à chacun de vivre cette expérience surtout que nous étions qu'à 25 min en métro de picadilly circus 15 min de covent garden 10 min de marche entre la station et l'appartement seulement 2 min du bus entre le bus et l'appartement en plus nous restons en zone donc vos déplacements ne seront que plus agréable. Je garderai précieusement ses coordonnées pour un prochain retour de mes parent. Merci encore pour tout à Catherine.
->Great apartment! Great host, highly recommend!
->We really enjoyed our stay in your apartment, Catherine! Thanks a lot for your help and your super fast answers. Good neighborhood and a nice and modern apartment.<br/>Thanks again for everything. Definitely recommended!
->She is a great host!<br/>We really loved her beautiful house.<br/>My kid wanted to live there for a month.
->Our stay in this apartment was awesome, it has everything you need for a confortable stay. Hosts are great! They provide to us all the informations we need and all the answers came really quickly. I highly recommend this place!!
->Es gibt Wohnungen die man am liebsten nicht bewerten möchte - weil man Angst hat das so viele andere diese auch buchen und wenn man wieder dort hin möchte ist sie ausgebucht :).... Wer hier bucht hat eine Gastgeberin die super schnell auf Fragen antwortet- mit jeder Menge interessanten Informationen - und einer Freundlichkeit die das verreisen über Airbnb zu einem fantastischen Erlebnis macht. Ich wüsste keinen Grund wieso man, wenn man nach London reist, hier nicht übernachten sollte. 7 min zur U-Bahn Elephant & Castle, 3 min zur Bushaltestelle wo man z.B. In weiteren 10 min an der London Bridge ist. Mit der U-Bahn 10 min bis Westminster - also absolute Citylage! Die Wohnung sehr, sehr modern. Wir waren einmal Frühstücken (im Breakfastclub) - muss mal sein :) Ansonsten haben wir die Küche genutzt: da ist alles: Kühlschrank, Herd, Toaster, Geschirrspühler etc.... Frühstücken mit Blick in einen Park - einfach super. Viele sprachen davon das das Essen in London ganz schön teuer werden kann - passiert hier nicht: Supermarkt ist in der Nähe! Ansonsten großes Bad, großes Bett, schickes Wohnzimmer - alles mit Thermostate ausgestattet. Wenn wir wieder nach London reisen (und das werden wir) hoffe ich das diese Wohnung frei ist - ich wüsste nicht warum wir woanders übernachten sollten. DANKE Catherine

REVIEWS:

->A little bit noisy, you can hear the trains and actually see them from the apt windows.  Hard to have a good rest if you are used to quiet spaces. It is located near Victoria Station.
->It was really noisy, right next to the tram. Also the fridge wasn’t cold when we arrived.
->Staying in William's flat by Victoria Station was extremely convenient and comfortable for our family of five. The sofa pulls out into a full sized bed, and the value cannot be beaten for staying in London with two adults and three kids. We were there during the hottest days on record, and William kindly left us three fans to dissipate the heat. We will absolutely stay here again if we have another night in London.
->Good location but noisy. The flat needs renovation and better maintennance. Otherwise all went O.K.
->Perfect location, great place. We had a wonderful stay
->Communicative host with flexible check in. Accommodation was in a great location, cheap and cheerful but could do with a bit of TLC (including some new bedding)
->Parfait du début à la fin du séjour. Première fois que nous prenions une location sur Airbnb et tout s est super bien passé. Très bon contact de l hôte , appartement extrêmement bien placé, avec 3 enfants qui ont adoré leur logement durant leur séjour, propre, proche du centre, rien à redire, parfait. Merci William.
->This simple apartment is clean and has all of the basics.  Very close to Victoria Station.  Some reviews mentioned the train noise, which is a factor, but the trains appear to stop running at midnight, so it was not a problem for our family.

->The apartment was super cozy and clean. We enjoyed the fresh sheets and comfy beds. Also such a bonus to have a yard! The place is bigger than it looks and we were very comfortable there. We also loved the park right behind us - great for kids, with playground, sand pit and nice for a jog. <br/>Would recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the London area ;)
->Lovely home in a great location. Clare and Matt were great hosts, very responsive and nice extra touches like leaving things for breakfast and recommendations for places to eat/things to do. Would stay again - thank you!
->Matt & Clare’s space was fantastic. The train information from Heathrow to their place made for a seamless and easy journey, especially for us who had no idea what we were doing. <br/>The house was small however the space was set up really well and we felt as though there was more than enough room for the five of us. We especially loved being able to use a washing machine and dryer. <br/>Matt & Clare provided eggs, fresh sourdough bread and the amenities allowed us to cook a home cooked meal which was a welcomed novelty after travelling around ! (Plus a coffee machine!!) <br/>Matt & Clare also provided an extensive list of things to do, and places to eat at which was so helpful for us London novices !<br/>The beds were so comfortable as was everything in the house, thank you again Matt & Clare.

->Absolutely fantastic. The apartment is well furnished and the hosts helpful. I would highly recommend.
->Clare was a perfect host who made sure that we arrived safely and had a comfortable stay. She had left us a few basics in food and beverages which was a nice touch and very welcome after our 6 hour drive. The house was warm, very clean and comfortable. We shall be back I am sure.
->Lovely apartment in a nice street. Lovingly  furnished and decorated in a quiet neighbourhood. Close to Lloyd Park and 15mins to the centre of Walthamstow. No hesitation in recommending.
->Lovely spacious flat, everything you need and homely.<br/>Clare was very helpful and communication was good. Very good value for the price
->Overall good stay. Upstairs neighbours a bit noisy.
->Nice cosy place to stay if you want to visit Londen. It’s a 15 minute walk to the underground, and a 20 minute ride to the centre of Londen. The house has all the comfort you need, good beds, nice living room, a fully equipped kitchen, and a great bathroom. Also the neighbors cat Frank is very friendly, and welcomes you every time : ). We traveled with our kids, and there was enough space for the 4 of us. We also would recommend the Turtle bay restaurant in Walthamstow if you are looking for a nice place to eat.

->Absolutely loved staying in Toms apartment. It was perfect with a beautiful view! I can't recommend it enough and would definitely love to stay again. It was easy to find and we managed to park across the road for free which was a bonus. I can't thank Tom enough as he made it extra special as it was my birthday!  
->Tom flat is simply stunning! great size, beautifully decorated and a breath taking view. Tom's email communication was quick, informative and relaxed. Although he wasn't around when we arrived, we were meet by a friend of his who was very helpful. Eggs and fresh bread were kindly provided which was a nice touch. The whole place was also immaculately clean.<br/><br/>I'd definitely stay here again and can thoroughly give my vote of confidence in Tom as a host.
->Apartment was beautiful and bright. Tom was super helpful. Would recommend highly. Near lots of lobelia Vietnamese restaurants and brilliant local pub on the corner. TOP MARKS TOM!
->Best Air BnB hosts I've had! Very welcoming and easy to contact. Would absolutely use again if in the area. Gorgeous flat in a great location on a quiet road but not far from shops and the tube.
->We arrived in London slightly delayed but Tom's sister waited for us and was really friendly as she showed us around. The neighborhood is lively and fun. The apartment is lovely. Although Tom was not there, the house was full of touches that made us feel very welcome. The bedrooms are comfortable and the bathroom is clean and modern. 
->We had a great stay at Tom's flat, communication about logistics was very friendly and quick. The photos almost don't do the flat justice, it really is very spacious and stylish, and quiet to boot. 
->Great flat! Nice, spacious, worked well for our family of three. Very easy access to busses and trains.  
->Flat was great, everything we wanted and more! Contact with both Tom and Debbie (Toms mum) when Tom was on holiday was fantastic. Very helpful in all aspects as we had to change our plans last minute, which did not pose a problem and we felt that we were accommodates very well. <br/>Would highly  recommend this apartment

REVIEWS:

->Clean place when checked in. 5~10mins walk to the traìn station and the place is near certain eatery like Macdonalds. Overall a really enjoyable experience
->The apartment was clean, and my favourite part of it has got to be the beautiful garden. It was a 10 min walk to the nearest underground station, and was not in too close proximity with Central London, but we enjoyed our stay anyway. :)
->La communication avec Brodie est très facile il répond au message et malgré sont absences a notre arrivée il nous avez indiqué la façon de nous rendre a l’appartement en détails. L’appartement est situé tout près d’une station de métro qui déserte le centre de Londres. Nous avons passé un super séjour merci Brodie 😉

->Casa molto confortevole, con tutto il necessario per preparare delle ottime colazioni, in ottima posizione, a pochi metri sia dalla fermata del bus che al centro tra le fermate della Tube di Kennington e Vauxhall. Appena ristrutturata, si trova in un quartiere molto tranquillo, dove abbiamo scoperto degli ottimi pub nelle immediate vicinanze. L'unica nota negativa è il letto con i cuscini un po' scomodi. Foto molto veritiere. Grazie di tutto Pablo.
->Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour dans cette charmante maison lumineuse. Chacune des pièce est fidèle aux photos et les espaces bien aménagés. La maison est à proximité des commerces (Tesco à 3mn) et des transports. Pablo est un hôte très arrangeant et aux bons soins. Merci pour tout! Mailinh
->Le logement de Pablo est vraiment magnifique : spacieux, lumineux, terrasse très agréable, proche des transports en commun (20-25 minutes du centre en métro ou en bus) et le Tesco est à deux minutes!<br/>Nous n'avons pas rencontré Pablo mais bien un de ses amis qui nous a remis les clefs et expliqué le fonctionnement de la maison. <br/>Bref, excellent séjour dans un environnement très agréable!
->Mi familia y yo nos hemos sentido como en nuestra propia casa. La vivienda de Pablo es muy cómoda, sus camas son grandes. Tiene un supermercado Tesco a menos de 3 min andando. Estación de metro de Vauxhall y Kenington a menos de 10 min andando, 25 min andando al Big Ben, muy bien comunicado. Trato muy agradable y fácil comunicación tanto por parte de Pablo como de sus amigos que nos recibieron.
->The house is located in a quite but safe neighbourhood, the house is spacious and clean with lots of sunshine! With 3 double-bed rooms, a group of 6 has no problem to fit in the house at all.<br/><br/>There is a Tesco within 2 mins talk and it's around 10 mins walk to either Vauxhall or Kennington station. From most of the tourist spots (ie. Oxford Circus, Piccadilly...), it's around 8-10 pounds by taking Uber :)<br/><br/>I highly recommend everyone to spend their London days at this wonderful house!  
->La casa de Pablo es preciosa, recién reformada, amplia....las fotos no le hacen justicia. Capacidad suficiente para seis personas. Destacar sobre todo la existencia de dos baños completos y un aseo, algo muy de agradecer cuando estas fuera de casa "compartiendo" piso. Por último destacar la ubiación, a 5 minutos caminando de la estación de Vauxal y a 10-15 minutos del Big-Ben. Han sido unas vacaciones fantásticas. Repetiremos sin duda.
->We loved Pablo's house!  Great communication in the lead up to our trip and Pablo kindly arranged that we could drop our bags early on the day of our arrival.  His friend, Phil, met us and showed us around.  The house is clean, bright, comfortable and well-appointed with a beautiful kitchen and back yard with big opening doors.  Our 14-year-old son was delighted to discover the PS4 and this saved us from teenage grumps!!!  The area is great, a short walk through a beautiful Georgian square to the nearest tube station, lots of restaurants and pubs and a big supermarket within a few minutes stroll.  Would definitely stay here again.
->The house is much better than we expected! The host respond quickly and is very responsible. The house is very clean and with all the amenities you need. We especially enjoyed the kitchen, we cooked breakfast every day. The location is good, the neighbourhood is queit and cozy, with a TESCO just in 3-min walking distance. This house is fantastic for a group of friends and family to stay, this is certainy our first choice when we visit London again.
->La estancia ha sido estupenda, ya que la casa ofrece todas las comodidades para pasar unos dias. Por otro lado, la ubicación es muy buena, porque es una zona tranquila y muy bien conectada con el centro de Londres. La atención del anfitrión ha sido genial y principalmente la atención de los vecinos. 
->Fantastic in every sense!!! The best airbnb house in London if you ask me for service, value, location and style! :)

->Really great location, highly recommend.
->Spacious, comfortable home in a fantastic location. Kelly was great to interact with and very prompt. Had a wonderful time!
->The house was such a cool haven for my daughter and me in a London heatwave - we value our time together and the spaces were perfect for us to relax in. It was close to the areas we know and enjoy and allowed us to walk easily to cafes, the movie theatre and local parks. Thanks, Kelly
->Departamento muy cómodo, fresco, buena ubicación; sector tranquilo y seguro , de fácil acceso a la movilización pública; solo es lamentable que no tenga Wifi; ya que siempre es necesaria.
->We had a wonderful stay at Kelly's home in Hackney. The flat was large and airy, and clean and bright. Bed linens and bath towels were clean and lovely, and there was plenty of closet space for clothes and a washing machine, and also a lovely patio. Check in and out was extremely easy and corresponding with Kelly was immediate and helpful. I would absolutely stay here again. The location is perfect. The neighborhood is lovely. I just absolutely loved this flat. The bathroom was luxurious, and the beds were comfortable, and the kitchen was big and clean. Nice and bright for a basement flat, and pretty gardens in front and back. Very quiet at night and just amazing all round! Thank you Kelly.

REVIEWS:

->The apartment was truly fantastic and exactly as described, the spacious garden and the tasteful interior design made us feel right at home. Everything we needed was provided. <br/><br/>Its location right in the center of beautiful Clerkenwell is ideal for reaching any point in central London within twenty minutes via Bus or Tube.<br/><br/>There are several spectacular restaurants and coffee shops nearby, and a small supermarket is right next to it. <br/><br/>Our hosts went above and beyond and made our trip to London a wonderful experience. From the point we arrived at the apartment they gave us a warm welcome, explained everything and also gave us tons of tips for our visit. Even during our stay we could reach them at any time.<br/><br/>For our next stay in London we will definitely come back here!
->Amir and Johnny are the warmest of hosts. I was met at the flat with flowers and wine. They were always available to answer questions and eager to make my stay as awesome as it was. The flat is a total gem only  minutes from all the London sights. The garden is just beautiful and relaxing after a bust day. The location has everything you would need with a wide variety of restaurants and tube within just minutes walk from the flat.  I give this flat and the hosts five stars and cant wait to go back for another stay as soon as possible.
->My daughter and I stayed for 9 days at Johnny and Amir's place and just loved it!  Fab furnishings, spacious accomodations, gorgeous deck, and very hospitable hosts.  Loved it!  Hope to make this my regular pad in London...
->The hosts of this property could not have been more helpful. From accommodating the needs of myself and my family to providing helpful tips and recommendations about the immediate area and what it had to offer. They were also kind enough to have the basics as well as some wine and other complimentary items available. <br/><br/>The apartment was clean, it was spacious as well as stylish and the garden to the rear an added bonus. It is exceptionally located for bars and restaurants as well as accessibility to a number of other key London locations.<br/><br/>Arrangements for access was simple and entry was self explanatory, as was the functionality of the property. <br/><br/>We would (and probably will) return to stay at the apartment if it has not become booked out solid by the time we look to revisit!<br/><br/>I genuinely could not recommend the property or the hosting experience more. You will not be disappointed. <br/><br/>
->We have just spent 9 nights here for work and the apartment made everything so much easier and felt like a home away from home. It is very well equipped and perfectly comfortable, easily spacious enough for four people. The garden is a real bonus, lovely to have a bit of peace and tranquillity in such a busy area. The location is excellent, minutes away from Farringdon tube station with lovely restaurants and coffee shops just across the road. There's even a Sainsburys two doors down for all your essentials. <br/>Amir kindly met us on arrival and showed us around, even left us wine and fresh flowers - very thoughtful (and appreciated!)<br/>I absolutely wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and have already recommended it to friends.
->We had the best vacation in London!  Thank you Johnny and Amir for letting us stay in your beautiful apartment!  The location was great as we were so close to so many things.  The back yard was particularly delightful!  Johnny answered all our questions immediately and gave us a lot of helpful information.  There were no pictures of the bathroom on the airbnb site but it was just a delightful as the rest of the apartment. 
->Top notch experience.  Would stay there again.  Description of unit - accurate. Pre check in coordination - helpful and easy.  Check in - on time.  Stay - great; unit was comfortable, functional, in a great area- close to various neighborhoods of interest; well protected from outside sound; high quality in general- windows, plumbing, electric, Internet etc.  Private garden a huge plus.
->We had a lovely time! The whole experience was above our expectations from the great welcome at the appartment with fresh fruit, wine and flowers until we left the appartment. The appartment is spacious, clean, equiped with all the appliances neeed to make your stay as comfortable as being at your own home. Big windows offer a lot of day light. Neighborhood is nice, there's a local shop just besides the appartment and a lot of restaurants so you can easily go out for a luch or dinner. We plan to come back as soon as possible!
->We stayed at Johnny's apartment - two adults and two kids under 3 for 3 nights. The apartment size was better than expected for such a central location and had everything we required. We were met at the apartment on time and given a quick tour before we made ourselves at home over a complimentary bottle of wine.<br/>The street had everything we required with a few supermarkets, bars, train station and restaurants in walking distance. We can highly recommend the Foxlow restaurant 2 doors down. We couldn't access the garden due to building works while we were there which Johnny had warned us about and reflected in the rate but from what we could see it is an excellent addition to a lovely apartment. 
->An unforgettable experience in London: the apartment is wonderfully furnished, perfect central location.<br/>Johnny and Amir welcomed us very warmly, with fresh flowers, sparkling wine - and not to forget a huge list of restaurant & shop recommendations!<br/>Since the weather was good, we could enjoy the garden, which is perfect for a little pause during a city trip!<br/>Thank you so much again for the "late check-out" and everything!<br/><br/>

REVIEWS:

->We had a great time staying here for 1 week. We loved the place as it was, as advertised, very clean and tidy as well as being in a great location in central London. The bed was very comfotable, the couch was great, the kitchen facilities were perfect and it seemed that the bathroom and the bathtub were newly renovated, very clean and nice. The apartment is on the top floor of the apartment which was great because it could let the daylight in due to the little windows on the ceiling both in the bedroom and the bathroom. The only downside may be that there is no lift for someone who is not prepared to carry luggages up and down but i think that there is a small price to pay for the location it is in. The apartment is spacious enough for 2 people for sure and friends can crash over at the sofa bed comfortably if privacy is not too much of a concern. Vito was a great host, he arranged everything very smoothly for our stay, kept in touch when we needed him and had someone professional to greet us when we arrived to show us the apartment and answer any questions we might have had. We are sure to stay here again when we re-visit London!
->Great space, comfortable in a very convenient locale just north of Oxford Street. Easily accessible from Heathrow and to all  main tourist attractions. Fantastically comfortable bed, not so comfortable pull out sofa bed.  Shower was luxurious! <br/>We were a late check in (9pm) and only after we had accepted booking were we told we would have to pay a £25 late check in fee. Also upon check in, we were told that there was a problem with the oven, we could use either the cooktop or the oven but not both at the same time- the lovely lady that checked us in advised us that this was going to be fixed the day after we left.  It was difficult to move luggage up to and from the third floor ( maybe 60 stairs), but that being said it was advertised as such. <br/>Communication was prompt and efficient with with Vito and the ladies that orchestrated check in. I only wish the weather had been more conducive to enjoy the lovely rooftop deck...maybe next time. 
->Great location, bars, restaurants, all types of shops, tube & bus very near.  The flat (gorgeous deco), great roof terrace, everything had been thought through to make our stay ideal. Full of nice attentions: hairdryer, coffee & tea, soap & shampoo, 2 mobiles for local use, etc ... Feeling of being at a friend's place.<br/>The (best Italian) landlord and the welcoming team are  very nice and helpful. Excellent stay, we strongly recommend.
->Vito's place is truly a gem! It is exactly as portrayed in the photos and description of the apartment. Loved the contemporary look of the apartment and it felt very bright and airy with all its skylight. The place was fully equipped, very clean and quiet, though situated on a street with lots of lovely shops, restaurants and all conveniences. Having lived in London before, I would say Vito's place is unbeatable in terms of location. It is exactly as he described it to be,close to all major sites and transportation. Round the block from his place is Manchester Sq, which is lovely and The Wallace collection is right there. Vito himself is a wonderful host, very helpful and prompt with replies from beginning till the end our stay. His staff was professional and was there waiting for us when we arrived. Everything went very smoothly and we would definitely recommend his place and would love to stay again. And he feels like a friend !!
->Vito and Anita (the property manager) are really involved, helpful and effective. The flat is well designed with a lot things (TV, WiFi, 2 mobile phones...) and a real kitchen. <br/>The location is great, close to Bond Street station. <br/>
->A lovely little space with everything you could want at your doorstep.  The roof deck was lovely even though it was too cold to use it and the concierge service was spot on.  The flat was tidy and clean, the bed was comfy and there were no problems or issues.
->Host and his team are easy to communicate with, and are clear & straightforward from the moment you message them.  Apartment itself is fine, most of it's value arises from the fact that it is in a great location, close to many restaurants, parks, shopping, and public transportation.
->Vito is a gracious host<br/>I used to live in London so I know it well and this flat i s in the best location. Well equipped, beautifully done up and perfectly located, but it's the roof terrace that really does it. Overlooking the heart of Marylebone village, I had great weather and enjoyed it from the terrace looking out at the neighbourhood.<br/>The intercom wasn't working so if you're hosting like me it's a tiny bit of a hassle to run down the stairs to let guests in. Apart from that this flat is fawless and really lives up to it's billing as a true gem in the heart of London. <br/>I look forward to visiting again.
->Fantastic host with a beautiful Apartment.<br/><br/>I have had over 4 different stays in London with different Airbnb hosts/locations but I would have to say that Vito and his apartment is my favourite out of all of them.<br/><br/>I will definitely reserve the apartment for my next stay in London.
->Hermoso departamento. Excelente ubicación en una zona ideal para enamorarse de Londres. <br/>Vitto y su equipo ofrecen todo lo necesario para tener una estadía placentera en el departamento. Lo recomiendo un 100%!!!

->Vito's flat is great. The roof top patio is great to enjoy a beer and a cigar with great views of the city. Location is convenient to great restaurants, shops and the Underground. <br/>I highly recommend Vito's flat.
->This is a cute apartment in a convenient location!
->Great location.
->This beautiful stylish spot in London is perfect to stay in, its warm and cozy and ideally located.  <br/>The layout and decor is of a high quality and it is what I would call very ‘grown up’ <br/>I enjoyed staying here and look forward to many more stays in the future, especially spring and summer when the roof terrace will be such a treat to make use of!
->Nice location, good value for the price
->Vito’s cute little space is perfectly located for all of the best things London has to offer. We had a wonderful stay over Christmas.
->The location is excellent, close to restaurants, shopping area and tube station. Check-in was very efficient and the apartment was extremely clean. You find everything you need. The terrace is beautiful and must be great during the summer. Highly recommended.
->vito's location was excellent.  The room was very clean and everything was ready.  There was a problem, but vito responded quickly.  Highly recommended
->If you’re looking for a place that is close to the underground tube station (Bond Street station), shopping stores (Oxford St), eateries and grocery store, this is the one! Vito’s flat is just about 5 mins walk to the nearest tube station (Bond Street) and the famous Oxford St (for shopping). Many food options around the area and grocery store is within a short walk. Check in/out was easy. Vito also has a guide book in his flat that was helpful. <br/>The flat was equipped with all that we needed for the stay except for one thing - unfortunately, the shower water heater wasn’t working properly. It started out with very very hot temperature and then just icy cold water. It was uncomfortable. Vito kindly arranged for a plumber to take a look at it however, the plumber did not show up on time, twice. Waited for an hour later on the second time and the plumber managed to do a temporary solve, no more icy cold water - just very hot  which we had to make do. Though this isn’t directly on the host, we appreciate his help and hope it gets fixed for the next guest. Aside from this situation, this place is still an ideal Airbnb.
->My family and I had an excellent stay at Vito’s apartment; lovely place- small and cosy and at a wonderful location. The place is just off oxford street with fantastic access to anywhere in London really and Vito is a great host. Would definitely stay here again.

->an excellent apartment in a great location. well equipped and very comfy bed.<br/>ideal home form home.  <br/>    
->This is a great option for a busy person (two).  The apartment is located 2-5 minutes  walk from 3 underground stops, major UK exhibit hall, plenty of restaurants and all sorts of shops and very cool pubs.  A Virgin Gym is 7 minute walk.  <br/>Peter was a caring host, after my inquiry about organic shops in the neighborhood, he had all the welcome basics for a snack and tea - organic!  That was very thoughtful!<br/>Apartment is minimalistic and stylish, but after all you have everything one needs for a long stay in London.<br/>
->My three week stay was comfortable. The apartment was quiet. Being on the top floor there were no overhead footsteps. The kitchen was adequate with the necessary dishes, pans and utensils for quick and light cooking. The bed was comfortable with plenty of storage space. The heating worked well. The lighting is decorative, but would have liked more functionality especially at the dining table and in the bathroom where small pot lights don't provide bright general lighting. The living room is large, good for entertaining. Peter is terrific as a host. He is quick to respond to all questions. When we had a mechanical problem, Peter had it fixed within a few hours even though it was a Sunday and a repairman had to be called in. One drawback to this apartment is the stairs. Being on the top floor makes it quiet, but it also requires using the stairs to go up and down. The area is close to perfect with plenty of services and shops, including 24 hour shops, pubs, restaurants and one of the best locations in the city for tube and bus transportation connections especially if you're arriving from Heathrow.
->We had a fabulous stay at Peter's lovely London apartment. We needed accommodation for around a month when arriving in London, before finding something more permanent.<br/><br/>The apartment is in a fantastic location and is an excellent base for exploring the sights of London. The local area is gorgeous, there are heaps of restaurants and cafes, a number of local supermarkets and excellent bus and tube links within easy walking distance. <br/><br/>Peter was a good host and accommodated our very early morning arrival time, had fresh croissants awaiting us and also provided a bottle of wine. He also kindly forwarded on some mail that arrived for us after we had vacated. <br/><br/>The quality of furnishings is high, the flat is light and the bed very comfortable. The kitchen has everything you need for basic food preparation. Because we enjoy cooking a lot we had to adjust to not having a dishwasher (not necessarily common-place in all London flats because of size) and not having a large oven. Peter has a good combi microwave oven which does the job - and we were still able to cook a full Christmas dinner! <br/><br/>The flat is exactly as it appears in the photos - modern, clean and welcoming.<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend a stay at Peter's place!   
->I stayed in Peter's flat for three months and it was a good place to come home to. The first pic you see, the living room, is a great room to hang out in. It's half a block down from the main street so it's quiet, but there's a Starbucks on one corner and a classic English pub, the Pembroke, on the other, as well as a music venue, the Troubadour, just next to it. A brand new high-end supermarket, Marks & Spencer, is on the 5 min walk home from the Earl's Court tube station.<br/>Peter is a good host and never failed to have a quick response to my concerns. He would check in periodically and schedule a maid service if I wanted it. The kitchen is adequate, a four-burner electric stovetop and a powerful microwave oven. The mattress is comfortable. It's nice being on the top floor. The stairway is recently painted and remodeled.
->We stayed in Peters apartment for 2 weeks during our visit to London in September.<br/><br/>We found the apartment to be great for our stay. Fast, reliable wifi, a comfortable bed and a washer / dryer combination machine were the aspects of the apartment which we valued the most.<br/><br/>The proximity to the Earls Court tube station, as well as grocery stores was also great.<br/><br/>Apart from a minor mix up with some lost mail and a spare set of keys Peter was a good host.<br/><br/>I would recommend anyone travelling to London to consider this apartment for their stay.
->We had a wonderful time in this flat, which was very comfortable and located in a great neighborhood close to great pubs, a wonderful Italian restaurant, Starbucks, and a great little pastry shop. The Earls Court tube station is a 10 minute walk and connects very conveniently to all the major lines. The flat is roomy, tastefully decorated, and very comfortable. There is lots storage space.  Peter was very helpful and accommodating. The only drawbacks that we found, minor in comparison to the positives, are that there is no oven and not much lighting in the living room. Overall, we were very happy and would recommend the flat to others. 
->Peter was very helpful in showing me around the apartment as well as being very detailed with the appliances throughout the apartment, such as the how to use the washing machine, the T.V, and the wifi. The apartment was very accurate to what the description. The neighbourhood is very quiet and is only a two minute walk away from earls court road where you can enjoy a number of places to visit. 
->Peter me recebeu super bem no começo, foi super prestativo com tudo e esteve sempre presente. Apenas no fim fiquei com o sentimento de ter sido convidado a me retirar do apartamento, lembrei um pouco aquela época que ficava em hotéis. Três pontos de atenção que considero importante para uma pessoa que irá ficar neste apartamento: você terá bastante escada para subir com mala pesada (assim como a maioria dos prédios em Londres mas tem que ser lembrado), minha impressão é que o apartamento nas fotos parece maior do que realmente é, por fim, não tive uma boa experiencia com a região de Earls Court, tive minha carteira roubada no caminho do metro Earls Court até o apartamento, o policial falou que esta região tem muito pickpocket.  Pontos positivos, uma cozinha super bem equipada, uma sala confortável com boa televisão e som, internet wifi rápida para quem precisa trabalhar é excelente, tabua e ferro para passar rouba disponível,  uma Starbucks do lado (para os viciados em café como eu... )
->Peter was a fantastic host and very helpful throughout my stay.<br/><br/>I was given detailed instructions on the apartment and its appliances upon arrival and even had a bottle of wine waiting for me in the fridge! The flat was also in a great location, only a couple of minutes walk from the nearest station. <br/><br/>My experience was so great in fact that I extended my stay for a few more weeks. Having moved to London for a new job, Peter and his apartment definitely relieved some of the stress of moving to a new city.

REVIEWS:

->The flat has a really good location especially if you love running as it is very close to Hyde Park. However it lacks central lighting so with the two side lamps it gets very dark at night and definitely would not describe it as bright. The pictures show the flat with and without the bed so it’s not as big as it would appear on the ad. There were a couple of issues on my arrival, which probably should’ve been checked, but great communication with the host and resolved promptly. The flat was generally clean when I arrived however the wardrobe interiors were covered in dust that I cleaned myself. Small things but they make all the difference.
->Sofia’s place was absolutely lovely and in a super prime location! truly a stones throw away from Hyde Park and Lancaster Gate! I booked parking across the street in Corus Hotel’s parking lot through JustPark app! Sofia was always available to check in about anything and always kindly fulfilled any requests I had to make my long stay comfortable  such as moving out an extra arm chair etc. Wifi always worked fast and smooth!Overall a fantastic stay for several weeks! Lot’s of towels and bedding! Would heartily recommend anyone! 😍
->perfect location!
->I had a wonderful stay at Sophia’s studio flat. The flat was clean, comfortable and in the perfect location for my month abroad. I will miss my morning walks in Hyde Park with the perfect flat white which was an easy walk from this flat. The Italian restaurant below was wonderful as well and the staff was incredibly kind. If I had any questions or concerns, Sophia was able to address them quickly and with kindness and grace. I am already planning my next trip to London and would love to stay with Sophia again.
->Perfect place to stay near Paddingtonstation and Hydepark
->Sofia’s flat was just as described and in a great location. It was easy to get the the tube and the entry to Kensington Park was a very short walk. The cafes right near the flat were impeccable. The Indian food down the street was the best I’ve ever had. I recommend  and would stay again.
->Sofia’s flat was very convenient home base for our travels. A less-than-10 minute walk to Paddington station!
->I have been in this place whole month and it was a great apartment! It’s small but comfortable and the localization is really great! Sofia also is a great host. When I had problem with something she tried to help me and fixed the problem. I can’t wait to come back to this place. 😊❤️
->Great place in a great location.  Paddington and Hyde Park just a few minutes walk and some great places to eat and drink in the neighbourhood.<br/>Although in a lively location the place is extremely quiet both morning and night.  The flat had everything we needed and was very comfortable.  Also felt really safe.<br/>Would recommend!
->Great location! Small simple place. Only complaint would be the comfort of the bed and pillows. We enjoyed our stay!

->Great little place!!
->Bruno's place is in a great location...a very short distance from the St. Pancras  station so coming in from Paris was easy.  The place itself is very clean and Bruno's communication is excellent.  We had a slight issue with a drain and someone was sent within 15 minutes to fix.  Wow now that's service.

->Very comfortable stay at Saskia and Giles’s apartment. The pictures are accurate and and the general shops and restaurants are on your doorstep. I also spent nearly everyday walking through Battersea Park, which now is my favourite park in London. Also enjoyed exploring the regeneration of Battersea Power Station.
