->This was a disaster but I will tell you why I will give it one more try:<br/>I booked the hotel because of location. Also price was attractive and of course based on photos it looked amazing. Whole hotel concept is great, I just wish they offer breakfasts as well but, and here it went wrong.<br/>I arrived to check in and receptionist didn’t know what to do. Fair to say she claimed I was first Airbnb guest. She have me the key from room and I went to check it out. When I opened the door, I thought she is joking. Room was empty. No sheets, no pillow, no blanket and bathroom was not cleaned. And of course no decor as presented on photos. I returned on reception and explained the problem, but I got answer this is the only room they have. I had to push hard to receptionist to start solving this so she called her manager and offered I can have a blanket, but there is no one to clean the room. I refused since the room was really, really filthy and towels and toiletries was missing as well.<br/>After a while me asking her to cancel my booking and leaving to hotel she called her manager again and offered then a different room. I went to check it out to find out this is a room from a photo so nice surprise! There the good news ended since bathroom was cleaned very poorly, someone’s toothbrush and toothpaste has been on the sink and filth and long dark hairs was everywhere. Spots and hairs on sheets was something I simply no surprise after that. Some personal belongings in the room... well. <br/>Worst think happen in the morning about 7:30 when somebody opened my room’s doors with the card and entered when I was at bathroom. Can imagine worth privacy breaking than that, honestly. So evidently, the lock on the door does not prevent anyone with the card entering your room. No privacy. <br/>I complained in the morning on the reception where happen to be manager of the hotel. He explained his point of view of the whole situation and described that as big series of miscommunication. Well, it still happened.<br/>Believe or not, I still believe the hotel would be great if proper housekeeping would be done and management work on communication and privacy issues.<br/>That’s why I will give it a one more shot. But currently, I cannot recommend it at all.

REVIEWS:

->This was a very disappointing stay with numerous issues. After booking Emiliano told us weeks later that we would not be able to check in until after 8pm which was extremely inconvenient. After email exchanges however we were able to check in around 10 (so a lot of fuss for nothing) and there appeared to be people in the apartment all morning, so was left unsure why he told us we would not be allowed to check in before 8!<br/>Before arriving Emiliano sent a few pushy emails suggesting we sweep, mop and hoover the room. I personally feel this is the hosts responsibility (however of course give the respect to leave it clean and tidy). Upon arrival I was shocked he could demand such expectations of cleanliness when the apartment is so disgusting. The bathroom looked like it had not been cleaned for years with grime accumulated in every corner. Hairs and dust were on every surface and bugs roamed the floor. <br/>The hallways floor was unclean leaving us to tread dust and dirt into the room. <br/>The kitchen and room were fine. Clean and comfortable bed.<br/>Emiliano kept stressing we must clean as the next guests were coming straight after us so I could only presume he does not clean the sheets in between guests. 
->Emiliano is very kind and answered kindly my questions before travelling. Though I couldn't meet him Emiliano's friends were cooperative. You can use their kitchen. Location is good but you usually have to walk 10-20 minutes to bus stop or subway station. <br/>Room is quite clean but bed's mattress was sagged. 
->Decent room, helpful host
->Great location and price.  Specific check in timing needs to be arranged with Emiliano.  Roommates were quiet when we were there.  Nice simple clean room. It's a good deal.    
->Room was nice and a good size. Emiliano was very friendly too. Hallway/bathroom a little bit grubby but overall was well worth the price.
->The host is very kind and communictive. The location is very good - close to the city centre.

REVIEWS:

->Noisy flat
->We never met Franciene, but her friend met us and was very friendly. The apartment is about two blocks from a tube stop and it's very easy to get to and from the city. The outside was a little weird because they were doing construction, but the apartment itself was very nice and we were given clean towels. My only complaint is that the wifi was down for the duration of our stay.
->Staying at Francine's 3 bedroom flat was nice. The flat is in a great location if you plan on using the tube and even has a Sainsbury's right by it. This place is a great deal for what you get. You do have to share the bathroom and kitchen with other Airbnb guests but it wasn't a problem for my fiancé and I. The last thing I would write about the flat is that you should let Francine know your ETA because she has a guy that lives downstairs let you in.
->Das Zimmer war ansprechend und sauber! Es hat alles super geklappt! <br/>
->I didn't meet Franciene but Bruno who was so kind.<br/>But I didn't like my flat because we were not in the room on the first photo but the second. And it makes a big difference. It's a very little bedroom. <br/>And There is some new construction just under the window!! They start at 7:30 a.m. and you can't stay sleeping. I think it's something that Franciene should say ! Because of that even if the flat has a good location our stay was not as well as we thought. 
->Really good place to enjoy London... Underground station is behind the corner and the city centre is very close. Recommended!
->Una agradable estancia. Limpio, con todo lo necesario, buena localización y muy atentos. Sin duda repetiría.
->공항에서 오는 방법을 설명해주었고 숙소근처 지하철역에 내렸을때 잠깐 헤맸는데 메신저로 연락을하여 정확한 위치를 알려주었다. 관광지들이랑 매우가깝다. 위치가 이 숙소의 가장큰 장점이라고 생각한다
->Muy buena ubicación, fácil conexión con el metro, muy buena atención de Bruno que nos recibió en la casa gente muy cordial y recomendable estancia, la habitación luminosa, agradable, limpia, confortable
->The flat is situated very close to a metro station, walk distance 3 minutes.<br/>In the flat there are three rooms,as we realized,our room was the smallest. We get another room as on the pictures was. The room was very small but enough for a couple, because we were in the room only for sleeping. A little bit dirty was our room.<br/>We never met Franciene, but her friend Bruno was very friendly,kind and helpful.He always helped by any problem.<br/>For a couple who are coming just for sightseeing,the flat is perfect.
