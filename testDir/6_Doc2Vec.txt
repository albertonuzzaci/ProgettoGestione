->Just brilliant - stayed 4 nights, felt like home

The shower is really low so has to pat attention. good heat, no noise in bedroom. 10 min walking from circle and central line so really good access to the center. there is tesco nearby and some nice pubs  in area. you also can go to portobello market - 15 min walking. Jihanne made it easy to check in and always available to help. Really good value for money.

->Very nice room and good facilities. Good quality of tissue paper.
->Very cosy flat and very well situation to discover all you want ! I will come back <br/>Jihanne is very reactive to have us a good stay !
->Stay from this inhuman and heartless host! I dont understand why this home is still in the listing. She cancelled the reservation and made me to move out in the middle of the stay without giving me any time to find another apartment. I had the worst time in London because of this Airbnb host but Airbnb is doing nothing to amend this. In order to prevent the same situation from happening, this home must be taken out immediateiy from Airbnb.

Well equipped kitchen with lots of  condiments, teas and coffee etc. Easy access using the key safes.<br/>The parking was fine at the weekend and overnight but it is worth checking with Tina what the situation is on weekdays. <br/>Good communication from Tina who was always available on WhatsApp or Airbnb if we had any questions. <br/>We very much enjoyed our stay and were glad to be her first customers.

->The absolute highlight of my AirBnB experience.<br/>The best choice for first-time visitors to London ( and of course if you are familiar with London there is no need to explain how convenient the place and how fair the price is ) Jiawei is a multilingual super host with an enthralling life story. This will undoubtedly be my top choice in the future  下次一定还来 ～～<br/>Overall <br/>- incredibly secure place,<br/> - close to everything in the city, 3 minutes' walking distance to metro <br/>- my favourite sainsbury nearby <br/>- a wonderful spot for outdoor exercise as well <br/>- most importantly, good design and vast inside space

->Joel are very kind and chatty, the house is clean and the space is large, the location is also very good, I feel very comfortable living here, I will want to stay here again next time, I think the price is very good than staying in a hotel!!!!!!
->The host is very responsive and supportive，the location is great！<br/>Two things to keep in mind：1） There is no showing facility （only bathtub，and it's in the bedroom on the carpet）2. The temperature of the hot water from the tub i<br/>was not consistent，sometimes it became cold and last for a while （after only 11 minutes ）<br/>Overall happy with the location and service.

->Good
->We really enjoyed our stay here. The location was great - able to travel to different places easily.

->From the original contact it has an amazing experience. Very prompt with replaying to emails and texts. The house was in great condition and was very central and easy to get to transportation routes. I would recommend this flat for anyone coming to London.  
->Fantastic apartment in a fantastic location. Super super amazing. Evgeniya provided good tips for where to eat: we fell in love with Pimlico Fresh.<br/><br/>Don't stay here if you don't like cats since you will be cat-sitting as well. <br/><br/>And before you book make sure and get confirmation from Evgeniya that their flat has been de-fleed since we got cat flee bites.<br/>
->What a Beautiful home, I felt like I was staying in a 5 star hotel! <br/>Evgeniya, was a friendly and accommodating host. I stay in London often, and this was definitely one of, if not the, nicest places I have stayed. It was also lovely to have their very friendly cat, Rita, purring around, as it made me feel quite at home.<br/>I look forward to going back.<br/>Thanks again :)

The apartment is modern with cool technology, access to a smart TV and very spacious. The apartment was cosy, safe and quiet. <br/>The apartment has a great location so it is easy to uber and get a tube around London. <br/>The hospitality was fantastic! Andrew was sooo helpful!

REVIEWS:

->Dimitry s flat is ideal for a long or short stay that s why I booked it in the past and I LL book it in the future. I like the flat because it has two parts: a small dining room and the bedroom adjacent. it is very clean and comfortable and has the added benefit if being 5 minutes from the station with a pub next door serving good food and drinks, two convenience shops that stay open latest night, a shop that sells alcoholic drinks and a cafe that opens early in the morning where you can have an English breakfast or just a coffee and a croissant. so you have all the comforts of home
->Great location right outside pimlico underground station so was a dream to find and easy check in and out.
->nice stay!!
->The apartment is really cute. Great location, easiest check in and possibly the best shower!! . Dmitry is very friendly and everything went smoothly. The only problem is had was it’s on the fourth floor and not lift and lugging a baby, a travel cot a big handbag and a suitcase wasn’t the easiest. That aside, it was great! :)
->Amazing stay for my one night trip. Very clean with cool additions like remote control skylight and bluetooth speaker in the bathroom mirrored cabinet. It was lovely and warm, close to the underground station and a pub & shops doors down from the apartment. Would definitely recommend.
->Nice Victorian set up <br/>Right in the heart of London,  free street parking from 630pm to 830 am<br/>Self check-in and check out<br/>Nice heating.<br/>20 mins walk to the American embassy, where we had an appointment
->After the first night here, I started itching and then when we returned to the room that next evening, the itching was very intense and my daughter and I saw a bed bug on the bed, we looked up what it was and quickly scooped up our belongings and went outside to then stand on the street and find a last minute booking at 11pm at night (with a child in tow). We checked in to another hotel and the itching became more intense and the bites became so huge and gathered together, and then my throat swelled up and I had trouble breathing. We called an ambulance and I ended up in a&e with an allergic reaction to a bed bug that had been biting me all night. I was there from 6am until 4pm and the doctors agreed I was bitten by a bed bug and I was having a severe allergic reaction and that had I not called an ambulance it could have been life threatening. The landlord has denied all responsibility and bearing in mind I live in a clean house and don’t travel, the bed bug came from this apartment and was brought in by one of the many travelers. I am traumatised. And just to add also, the towels are tiny and not big enough for an adult, there is no bath mat, the Matress protector had pubic hair and other dirt on it and there was no fitted sheet on top, just draped loosely over the protector. The carpet is filthy and the hospital said that bed bugs often live in the carpet of rental places. The landlord has denied all responsibility. He was told about it at 9pm at night so either had time to clean it, or didn’t look very well. But this is a bit of a horrid way to treat a victim and we certainly are shocked at the whole situation. Air bnb are also not taking this matter seriously. I’m traumatised not only by what has happened and what my daughter and I went through, and the fact that I was in a life threatening situation, but also by the way that this is not being Galen seriously and I am being blamed at bringing bed bugs in myself… don’t stay here because the landlord is really tricky and if anything happens you will have a big problem on your hands.
->VERY good communication
->The flat is small but in a very fun way! Great location right next to the tube with a wonderful little restaurant/pub next door! Be aware that the stairs on the way up are numerous and very skinny!

->an excellent apartment in a great location. well equipped and very comfy bed.<br/>ideal home form home.  <br/>    
->This is a great option for a busy person (two).  The apartment is located 2-5 minutes  walk from 3 underground stops, major UK exhibit hall, plenty of restaurants and all sorts of shops and very cool pubs.  A Virgin Gym is 7 minute walk.  <br/>Peter was a caring host, after my inquiry about organic shops in the neighborhood, he had all the welcome basics for a snack and tea - organic!  That was very thoughtful!<br/>Apartment is minimalistic and stylish, but after all you have everything one needs for a long stay in London.<br/>
->My three week stay was comfortable. The apartment was quiet. Being on the top floor there were no overhead footsteps. The kitchen was adequate with the necessary dishes, pans and utensils for quick and light cooking. The bed was comfortable with plenty of storage space. The heating worked well. The lighting is decorative, but would have liked more functionality especially at the dining table and in the bathroom where small pot lights don't provide bright general lighting. The living room is large, good for entertaining. Peter is terrific as a host. He is quick to respond to all questions. When we had a mechanical problem, Peter had it fixed within a few hours even though it was a Sunday and a repairman had to be called in. One drawback to this apartment is the stairs. Being on the top floor makes it quiet, but it also requires using the stairs to go up and down. The area is close to perfect with plenty of services and shops, including 24 hour shops, pubs, restaurants and one of the best locations in the city for tube and bus transportation connections especially if you're arriving from Heathrow.
->We had a fabulous stay at Peter's lovely London apartment. We needed accommodation for around a month when arriving in London, before finding something more permanent.<br/><br/>The apartment is in a fantastic location and is an excellent base for exploring the sights of London. The local area is gorgeous, there are heaps of restaurants and cafes, a number of local supermarkets and excellent bus and tube links within easy walking distance. <br/><br/>Peter was a good host and accommodated our very early morning arrival time, had fresh croissants awaiting us and also provided a bottle of wine. He also kindly forwarded on some mail that arrived for us after we had vacated. <br/><br/>The quality of furnishings is high, the flat is light and the bed very comfortable. The kitchen has everything you need for basic food preparation. Because we enjoy cooking a lot we had to adjust to not having a dishwasher (not necessarily common-place in all London flats because of size) and not having a large oven. Peter has a good combi microwave oven which does the job - and we were still able to cook a full Christmas dinner! <br/><br/>The flat is exactly as it appears in the photos - modern, clean and welcoming.<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend a stay at Peter's place!   
->I stayed in Peter's flat for three months and it was a good place to come home to. The first pic you see, the living room, is a great room to hang out in. It's half a block down from the main street so it's quiet, but there's a Starbucks on one corner and a classic English pub, the Pembroke, on the other, as well as a music venue, the Troubadour, just next to it. A brand new high-end supermarket, Marks & Spencer, is on the 5 min walk home from the Earl's Court tube station.<br/>Peter is a good host and never failed to have a quick response to my concerns. He would check in periodically and schedule a maid service if I wanted it. The kitchen is adequate, a four-burner electric stovetop and a powerful microwave oven. The mattress is comfortable. It's nice being on the top floor. The stairway is recently painted and remodeled.
->We stayed in Peters apartment for 2 weeks during our visit to London in September.<br/><br/>We found the apartment to be great for our stay. Fast, reliable wifi, a comfortable bed and a washer / dryer combination machine were the aspects of the apartment which we valued the most.<br/><br/>The proximity to the Earls Court tube station, as well as grocery stores was also great.<br/><br/>Apart from a minor mix up with some lost mail and a spare set of keys Peter was a good host.<br/><br/>I would recommend anyone travelling to London to consider this apartment for their stay.
->We had a wonderful time in this flat, which was very comfortable and located in a great neighborhood close to great pubs, a wonderful Italian restaurant, Starbucks, and a great little pastry shop. The Earls Court tube station is a 10 minute walk and connects very conveniently to all the major lines. The flat is roomy, tastefully decorated, and very comfortable. There is lots storage space.  Peter was very helpful and accommodating. The only drawbacks that we found, minor in comparison to the positives, are that there is no oven and not much lighting in the living room. Overall, we were very happy and would recommend the flat to others. 
->Peter was very helpful in showing me around the apartment as well as being very detailed with the appliances throughout the apartment, such as the how to use the washing machine, the T.V, and the wifi. The apartment was very accurate to what the description. The neighbourhood is very quiet and is only a two minute walk away from earls court road where you can enjoy a number of places to visit. 
->Peter me recebeu super bem no começo, foi super prestativo com tudo e esteve sempre presente. Apenas no fim fiquei com o sentimento de ter sido convidado a me retirar do apartamento, lembrei um pouco aquela época que ficava em hotéis. Três pontos de atenção que considero importante para uma pessoa que irá ficar neste apartamento: você terá bastante escada para subir com mala pesada (assim como a maioria dos prédios em Londres mas tem que ser lembrado), minha impressão é que o apartamento nas fotos parece maior do que realmente é, por fim, não tive uma boa experiencia com a região de Earls Court, tive minha carteira roubada no caminho do metro Earls Court até o apartamento, o policial falou que esta região tem muito pickpocket.  Pontos positivos, uma cozinha super bem equipada, uma sala confortável com boa televisão e som, internet wifi rápida para quem precisa trabalhar é excelente, tabua e ferro para passar rouba disponível,  uma Starbucks do lado (para os viciados em café como eu... )
->Peter was a fantastic host and very helpful throughout my stay.<br/><br/>I was given detailed instructions on the apartment and its appliances upon arrival and even had a bottle of wine waiting for me in the fridge! The flat was also in a great location, only a couple of minutes walk from the nearest station. <br/><br/>My experience was so great in fact that I extended my stay for a few more weeks. Having moved to London for a new job, Peter and his apartment definitely relieved some of the stress of moving to a new city.

  name: Romantic flat near central London zone 2
  description: Beautiful flat in Willesden Green on the Jubilee line and 20 minutes to centre of town. Access to large garden shared with friendly neighbours. Old four-poster bed in bedroom. Cosy book lined living room. Child friendly (but cot not included!)<br /><br />A very sweet and gentle cat lives in the house so cat lovers only!
REVIEWS:

->Perfect location on the fast jubilee line into town. Beautiful secluded spot with a brilliant garden space. Charlie bailed me out last minute when another Airbnb cancelled last minute. Hugely accommodating and excellent communication. Thanks Charlie!
->Lovely stay at Charlie's flat - she was really helpful in advance of my visit and provided all the details I needed, including helping with parking.  The flat is lovely and in a great location - Charlie even called to check everything was ok.  I would definitely stay there again and would highly recommend it! 
->Charlie was a fantastic host! She spent time recommending restaurants for my boyfriend and I, she gave us easy to follow directions and when we arrived were given the keys by a very friendly and welcoming neighbour! Charlie took the time by making us feel very welcome with a personalised note and chocolates and giving me a call to ensure everything was okay for us! The flat was beautiful and advertised exactly right- very romantic and cosy! I loved the four poster bed and the decor is quirky and fun making me wish I could stay longer! Thankyou Charlie for a wonderful stay and making my birthday very special! 
->Had a great week in Charlie's flat. It is exactly as listed and was lovely inside. Great transport links into central London, had a supermarket, pub and a couple of cafés within walking distance too. Charlie was kind enough to leave us some milk and made contact on the arrival day to ensure all was ok. Loved having a cat as a visitor, made it feel even more homely. Would definitely recommend a stay here to anyone. Thanks 
->Charlie made us feel truly welcome with milk and tea and a brilliant, concise and personalised listing of how everything worked and where everything was. The apartment itself is stunning. Beautifully decorated  and clearly loved. It is easily found and in a gorgeous old building. The private gardens are wonderfully calm and well-kept and it's just a stone's throw from the Tube and loads of bus routes. Charlie was extremely flexible with arrival and departure times which is always a relief. My only regret is that Whisper the cat didn't pop in for a visit! Thank you Charlie for sharing. Emeline & Adrian
->My boyfriend and I had a brilliant stay at this apartment and was made so special with Charlie's help. The apartment is well looked after and really does provide a little romantic getaway. The location is great for seeing the city and getting to nearby restaurants. Charlie did ask if we minded if her cat was around and we said that was fine which was lovely to receive a little wake up call each morning. Overall really good experience with a very helpful host! 
->We had a wonderful weekend in London! Charlie was really accomodating and went above and beyond to help with the booking, our stay and tips for the area, even though we didn't get to meet. Distance to the centre is great (I'd say you get everywhere in half an hour), tube nearby. We flew in to Luton, which has a direct trainconnection to Chricklewood, approx 10 min walk from the house. The appartement is romantic/cosy and a pleasant place to stay. The cat kept sort of a respectful distance, just came in for a curious glance, probably sensing we're not catpeople. Charlie made it clear we could lock her out if we wished, but we rather enjoyed her presence in the end :)
->Had a great stay at Charlie's place and would highly recommend it for a genuine airbnb experience.  The property description is accurate and Charlie was a competent and thoughtful host especially as she was hosting at a distance.  The flat has been lovingly decorated, is supplied with essentials, and is a comfortable home away from home.  Whisper the cat was well behaved but Charlie did make clear she is an optional visitor.  The flat is close to local amenities, including a great Indian restaurant, and good transport links.  Perfect for a romantic get-away or comfortable short-stay in London.
->Beautiful flat! Warm and cosy, and charlie really made us feel at home. We didnt get to meet but she gve perfect directions and checked up to make sure things were going well. Highly recommend this airbnb flat!
->My expectations were surpassed when I arrived at Charlie's lovely flat in the Alexandra Mansions. It's a truly unique space with interesting pieces throughout, and a fabulously stocked wall of books!<br/>Charlie was a really relaxed host and made sure me and my boyfriend had all the information and reassurances we needed to facilitate an easy stay.

->Svetlana is the best host ever!!! She responded quickly to every msg. She made everything so easy for me and my newborn baby. The apartment is squicky clean, and beautifully styled. I recommend 💯... cldnt have picked a better place!!!👌 thank you Svetlana! Miss your home already 😂
->Excellent host, and lovely property. Everything was as expected. we only had to arrange for parking which we expected to be available in the package according to the property description, however, that was not the case when we checked in as building parking circumstances had changed more recently but the property description had not. All alternative options were not suitable due to guest mobility issues but we were able to make alternative, private parking arrangements with the hosts assistance. The host was gracious enough to add complimentary maid services for the misunderstanding and that was very much appreciated. Thank you Sven! I wouldn't hesitate to book this property again in future visits.

REVIEWS:

->I really enjoyed Rama&Alioune's apartment. Located near King's Cross station you can easily get to anywhere you want. The place itself is very cozy and feels like home. The neighbourhood is very lively with many restaurants and cafes located near the flat.
->My stay has been great! I've not met Rama & Alioune, but they gave clear instructions on to where to get the keys so there were no problems whatsoever. The flat was at a perfect location, clean and it had everything we needed for our stay over the weekend. It is located at quite a busy area, but we did not experience any noice disturbance at night. I would definitely recommend it. 
->Nice location, very central, with supermarkets around.
->Very good experience. Many thanks both.

REVIEWS:

->Great central location. Very functional and clean apartment. While it was not a problem for us at all you should be aware that this particular apartment #6 is on the 5th floor with no elevator. Again, we were fine with it.
->nice and cosy apartment ! <br/>the down side is just there is no lift inside the building.
->Nice 2 bedroom apt in great location.
->A convenient and comfortable apartment in Holborn, much recommended!
->Thank you for the great room.<br/>Near by the central, very clean and quiet.
->The flat had plenty of space with 2 double bedrooms and an open lounge. My favorite was the wall of windows in the lounge/kitchen, which let in lots of natural light and fresh air. It was easy to get in and out of the building and apartment with codes instead of a key, wifi was fast, and the dishwasher & washer/dryer were nice to have for my longer stay. Regina was a bit slow in communication, but the Flying Butler team, who manages the flat, were very responsive once they were in touch the week before my stay. It was also nice to have cleaners come mid-week! Overall, a great flat, and I would stay there again.
->エレベーターはありません。<br/>荷物の受取は可能です、チェックインは机の上の端末で行います。シャンプー・リンス等は数日分はあります。オーブンを使うと、火災報知器がなる可能性がありますので、必ず換気扇を付けた状態で行いましょう。
->Great location: central enough to be near the main attractions and subway lines while quiet enough to enjoy your stay in the apartment
->I booked the one bedroom which happened to be Flat 4. I did not know at the time that the online pictures were a representive of multiple suites. So, the suite was not what I expected. After voicing my concerns, they moved me to another flat the next day, Flat5. The representitve who came to check me in to the other flat was very nice and helpful. They have cleaners who come once a week on a specific day. <br/>The apartment is in a great location close to the Holborn tube station. There are also plenty of restaurants on the street.
->这个公寓非常好，设施完善干净，空间足够宽敞，非常建议入住，但是没有电梯，如果行李重，需要费很大力气提上去。

->Very nice, very good value for money and easy check in
->Such lovely and clean place, we loved it 😊
->Great stay
->Outstanding stay! Staff were lovely and the apartment was everything we needed. Highly recommend! Great location too!
->Excellent place
->We enjoyed our stay at 88 Studios. It was ideally placed for our visit to Kensington Palace and to explore Notting Hill. The room was as described, clean and well equipped.
->Nice.
->Room was very small, not at all like the pictures, was supposed to check in at 10am but was told we’d have to come back for 1pm because our room was occupied but was not told anything about it prior. The room is alright, was clean and modern but wouldn’t be able to stay more than a night. Very much like university accommodation.
->Amazing location, the place is better in person! Definitely recommend

  name: The Chelsea Apartment by House of Kip
  description: When it comes to elegance and grace, one bijou home stands apart – and it’s slap bang in the middle of everything! Tucked in a private gated development on the King’s Road, The Chelsea Apartment is stylish and reassuringly serene. There’s a suggestion of blue's to the sitting room, while the crisp white walls and Scandinavian contemporary wall art lend effortless flair. So, lie back and let those shopping bags drop, or slip on your Manolos and make the most of a truly sparkling location.
REVIEWS:

->Great location. Small but functional and aesthetically pleasing pad.
->Place quite small, but clean and visually appeasing. Good communication and all, no problem on that end. The water pressure in the shower was quite bad. Also, the unit is located right on top of the courtyard entrance to the street so it catches a lot of noise with movement and closing and opening of the entrance door. Also on the first level facing the street, catching some of that street noise. Not ideal if you don't want to wake up early in the morning.
->Great location.  Bus stop close to studio which was great for getting around. Short walk to Victoria and Knightsbridge. Wonderful walks up and down Kings Road. So many restaurants and coffee shops to choose from. Lots of places to do exercise classes. Studio has everything anyone would need, very modern & peaceful location and safe. Washing machine was brilliant. Communication with House of Kip was great. Chelsea in bloom was on so Kings road looked amazing. Would highly recommend staying in this studio.
->Cute & clean. Loved it!
->A very attractive place to stay, it’s small but very well designed. It’s position on kings road is useful, and communication with the owner were good.<br/>I look forward to staying there on my trips to london.
->The apartment was too cold at night.
->Good location on King's Road, but a bit far from the supermarket and the underground station. Luckily there are several buses at the doorstep.<br/>The apartment is generally good and clean, but the shower didn't work properly, even after being fixed twice, only drizzle water out of the showerhead. The quality of the show kit isn't good. A reminder to the next customer: ask the host if the show kit works properly before you check-in. <br/>The washbasin is very tiny, and could only use for washing hands. <br/>The response from the host is quick and prompt.
->Great location and great space.  Would totally go back.
->Place was overall really nice, just had issues with the check-in which is why we rate 4 stars instead of 5.
->The location was great, however:<br/>1. There were used underwear by the side of the bed (still there when we left) which heavily questions the cleanliness of the place. <br/>2. There was a lot of dust/chimney debree by the chimney when we checked in. <br/>3. There was hair in the shower. <br/>4. The toilet sink was clogged. <br/>5. The garbage bin was broken (permanently open) so the room smelled badly unless trash was taken out daily. <br/>6. The shower did not function properly. <br/>7. The apartment is located right over the main gate of the block. The other tenants were not carefully closing the gate, allowing it to slam loudly and continuously waking us up over the night. The door mechanism must be adapted if one is to sleep in peace. <br/>While the apartment location is nice, for the price we paid we expected significantly more and are overall disappointed.
