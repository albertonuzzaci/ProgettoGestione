  description: It is a really big room in a lovely house in Kilburn. It is really close to the high street and overground and underground stations. We share the house with Mirto and Tasos who are very easy going and friendly.
REVIEWS:

->Though we didn’t have the chance to meet Christina, she was super fast with the responses and super helpful with all we need. Her Flatmates are amazing people, easy going and as well, very helpful with every we needed. The room is quite big and very comfortable. We loved that they let us use all the amenities in the kitchen, so we cooked our own breakfast and dinner. In summary, we totally recommended this Airbnb (we liked so much that we booked a couple more nights!), Christina and her Flatmates are great, so don’t hesitate to book it!
->Friendly & helpful hosts
->Great room, little cozy garden in the back and at literally 2 minutes from groceries, tube and overground. Very easy going flatmates!

->Annamarie is a great host. The room was clean and just what I needed. Very central to the tube station. Would definitely stay with Annamarie again.
->Beautiful apartment, exactly as pictured. Annamarie is sweet and welcoming, and had great stories and tips about the area.  Felt clean and safe as well. <br/>Great location! Just a block or so outside of the touristy bustle of central Camden, so it's quiet and a residential neighborhood but less than a 5 minute walk to tons of great locations, and super close to many bus and underground stops. Can get to any tourist attraction within 20 minutes. <br/>Would definitely stay here again! Thanks Annemarie!

->Great welcome from a very helpful and happy host, great location and communication, spotlessly clean, nice space, comfy bed, awesome!

All rooms are colorful and bright (bed and bathroom with windows to the silent backyard) and lovely interior. Next underground is just 5 min walking (Camden Town). Her cat wolfi is also very welcoming, cute and cautious. Thank you Annamarie for making me feeling home for this short stay at beautiful London City 🙏🏼🌞

->Amazing, fun and chilled environent. Clean, great bed and coffee and tea offered. Natasha was great for a chat and went beyond to make me feel at home.
->A cosy, comfy single room in a warm, welcoming household.<br/>This room is a gem of a find in a very expensive part of London. There’s desk space to work and a comfy single bed. If you’re travelling solo for business or just fun this is a perfect space that will allow you to stay in a really trendy London borough on a budget.<br/>Natasha was just the loveliest host - a fabulous communicator, she even allowed me to check in a little early. Everything was freshly cleaned and laundered in the room and I had a clean towel provided. I was given a cup of tea on arrival and even invited to share dinner! The bathroom is shared but there was a great shower and plenty of hot water.<br/>You should be aware that some of the household smoke - there was no smell in the room - so if you are super-sensitive to that then this may not be the place for you. I’m a non-smoker and it didn’t bother me.<br/>I would definitely use Natasha again if I’m in this part of London.
->Natasha and her housemates are lovely and very welcoming. Communication was excellent and I will definitely stay again if I’m in the area. Room was clean and comfortable.
->Truely an amazing and lovely host. Natasha drove me to a pharmacy for a migraine, leant me a jacket for the cold and was just so friendly and her girls were so kind and helpful too (asking if I wanted anything from the shop etc!) the room was so cosy too. I really enjoyed my stay here.
->Natasha is a very friendly bubbly girl,  excellent  communication , the room in her house was clean and tidy and convenient  for my purpose  as i was going to see a band at the kentish town forum which was a 15 mins walk away, would stay again if i was coming to the area in the future
->Natasha is an absolute gem and the room is a 'does what it says on the tin' job. Highly recommend.
->Natasha is a lovely, welcoming host. Comfy bed and super convenient location just around the corner from Gospel Oak overground. Thanks!

The studio is full of light, airy, practical, and very good value for the price. Maria was a perfect host, quick to respond, and she gave us many insider tips as to what to see. Would definitely stay again.
->Cosy set up in charming west hampstead

->We stayed for three nights and had an amazing time!<br/>The very beautiful house is in a quite, but still very well located street. Some nice restaurants and supermarkets are just around the corner and so is the tube station, which makes getting to the city fairly easy. Camden Town Station (Camden Market) is only one station away, but it’s also very easy to walk there. <br/>Elena is just super-friendly and her hospitality is fantastic. The house was spotless clean and extremely cozy. We did not have anything to complain about. Top pick! Absolutely recommendable!<br/>

She recommended the nice places in London, so we were able to feel the real atmosphere of London. <br/>Her Bnb was so clean and nice.<br/>It had great location so you can get to the tube station in 5 min, which makes it easy to travel city central. Also, her place is very close to Camden market and the beautiful parks like hamstead heath, so you will be able to enjoy the local culture.<br/>No reason to hesitate!<br/>완전 좋아요! <br/>호스트도 정말 좋은 분이셨고, 덕분에 런던 여행을 제대로 할 수 있었습니다.<br/>방 분위기도 좋고 엄청 깨끗해서 호텔 같았어요.<br/>위치도 2존이기는 하지만 1존과 매우 가깝기 때문에 여행하기에 굉장히 편리합니다. 오히려 주변에 캠든마켓같은 관광지나 야경을 즐길 수 있는 아름다운 공원들이 많기때문에 더 좋았던 것 같아요. 현지 분위기를 느끼고 싶은 분들에게 강력하게 추천합니다.<br/>

Our room was extremely clean and spacious, with the common areas being large and full of character. The place features beautiful front and back garden patio areas as well. We enjoyed talking to Elena who was very easy going, offering a lot of helpful advice and information for things to do and see, she also respected our privacy when needed. The neighborhood was perfect, very easy to get to all the sites in the city, while still being on a quiet and peaceful road for a good nights sleep. The tube is just a short 5 minute walk away, along with the heart of Kentish Town full of restaurants, pubs, and other conveniences; Camden Town is just a few blocks further. Highly recommend and would stay again without hesitation.

Le quartier est très bien desservi et proche du centre : parfait !                                             Elena's home is like her : beautiful, full of light and welcoming ! We felt like home !

->Convenient location, pleasant stay, reasonable price, and oh, good cup of coffee. I enjoyed breakfast in the backyard. Paul is a good host.
->Paul has been super welcoming and so nice. He had a beer and martini upon arrival and stay up chatting straight away. The place has a great outdoor area which is nice to sit in the sun, weather permitting. Location is so central you couldn't get much better. While it's not a 5 star hotel, it is definitely clean and with a relaxed home environment. You can chill out privately or have a chat with Paul, or even sit around and watch TV. Highly recommend this place to anyone! Paul was a great host!!
->We had a great stay at Paul's place during our shopping spree in London. The communication lines are perfect with the buss to Camden Market just around the corner and both the underground and hop-on-hop-off busses leaving from Kings Cross. A nice breakfast in the morning and then off. Even though his house is near St Pancras Station it is a very quite neighbourhood. Despite the wether being cold and mostly rainy we spent saturday night on the patio drinking wine. Must be a really lovely place in summer! We were not that impressed by the hygiene standards, but hope Paul will take care off that after he has the reconstruction done. It would be nice to come back there!
->Paul was very nice and accommodating, even offering me a beverage upon arrival. The room was nice, with room closely located. I'd stay again!<br/><br/>
->Paul was a great host. Very accommodating with our busy and tight schedule.

His home is absolutely lovely and has a terrific ambience.. bright, warm clean, great shower, comfortable bed, ample space. The pinball machine is wicked!! the underfloor heating divine!!

->Great location. Great host.
->Great place and great host
->Brian and his wife are very friendly and supportive. <br/>They also prepare the breakfast for me with the bread and coffee even though it wasn't included in the booking. <br/>The room is comfortable and clean. The location is good, just about 7 minutes walk to the underground or 5 minutes to bus stop.<br/>I also fell in love with the dog and the cat in the house.
->The stay was fantastic in all aspects. The room was really clean and cosy. Tijen and Brian are the best hosts I have ever met! Excellent communication and helpful. I recommend staying here when in London.
->Brian is very friendly and helpful. He is a good host and a good advisor. He helps me and my son whenever we are in need. The location is excellent as it is very close to Camden Town. It is valuable to stay in his house.
->A lovely place..with great connections to public transport..and food..and camden market. Very quiet keeping in mind it is bang in the centre of town
->This is a lovely place that is clean and in a great location. Very close to camden market and Kings cross. Tijen kindly introduced me lots of great places around! Highly recommend this place!!
->I had a lovely stay at Brian’s place. It’s a well designed and comfortable space in a great location.
->Great location and great hosts! In a very central area about a 5 min walk from a tube station
->It was a great stay! The room was spacious, sparking clean and well set up. I found the desk and chair very comfortable and the wifi strong, so this is also an excellent option for someone who needs to get some work done. The bathroom was very clean, with strong water pressure and ample hot water. It is also very private, as the family lives upstairs and the room and bath are on the main level. It actually feels like its own separate apartment. I was lucky enough to share a tea with the family one night, they are very kind and made me feel very welcome. As others have mentioned, the location couldn’t be better. It is right in the middle of the Camden action, but on a quiet side street where you would have no idea you were so central. Also, walking distance from Kings Cross/St Pancreas. Its also a good base for exploring other parts of the city as Camden is central/north and I found it walking distance to much of central London (i like to explore by walking) with many transit options close by, including the overground to east london. Overall I found this to be an excellent stay and would absolutely return next time I am passing through the city

->I stayed at Danya's appartment and it was exactly as stated on the post.<br/>for me it was what I was looking for.<br/>Thanks Danya
->Danya was a great host! Very friendly and supportive!  Her flat was very close to public transport and in a few minutes you can reach everything! Thanks again Danya for a great time!
->Danya's flat is incredibly well located, clean and tidy. She was an excellent host and provided us with all information and services we needed. Communication with her was always easy. I highly recommend her flat.
->Unfortunately (for) Danya was ill,  but her welcome was still very welcome. Thanks for that Danya. She gave us a great tip to eat and made a reservation for us.   The flat was very quiet good location and bed were perfect.
->Location is good. Plan on 45 to 60 minutes walking to get to major sites. Tube is within 10 minutes. Bus service not good. Need to transfer and confusing if not knowledgeable.  Walking was as fast as the bus. Overall was satisfactory. 7 out of 10. Flat was typical, small by our standards but the norm in UK. Danya was a good host.  Would stay there again.
->Danya was very generous and hospitable, going out of her way to make sure we had all we needed. Her flat is very clean. She made tea for us in the evening and showed us great places to eat. My son and I felt very welcome at her place, we were lucky to find such an accomodation. Thanks Danya!
->Danya went way out of her way to help us feel welcome in her home in every way possible. She is a remarkably warm and caring person.
->Very good locations, close to the metro station, shops, restaurants and even pubs.<br/>Clean and tidy.<br/>But perhaps the biggest plus is Danya- warm, helpful, with a sense of humor.<br/>I'm sure that she also had something to do with the beautiful weather throughout my stay in London. <br/>Thank You.
->Danya is a really nice host, she cares about your specific needs and is ready to help you with anything you would need. I would definitely recommend spending some time at her place, she can also take you out for dinner and give you some advice on what is nice to do in London. Unfortunately we didn’t spend as much time as we wanted with her but will definitely make it right next time ! 
->Danya is a really nice host. Friendly and considerate. The flat is really nice too. In a good position and very clean. Hope to see her soon in the future.

->This is a lovely house in a quiet neighbourhood near Euston, Kings Cross and the vibrant Camden Town and markets.<br/>The large bed is very comfortable.<br/>Paul, the host, is most welcoming and friendly.<br/>Thanks for the beer and tea!<br/>Highly recommended.
->Paul is a perfect host for us. We asked so many requests before and after our stay. Every time he smiled and accepted our requests. Thanks to Paul, we had a great time in Europe. We strongly recommend to stay!
->Paul was super welcoming and friendly.  His place is quite cool - and very centrally located and easy to get to.  Definitely recommended!  
->This was my first time in London and it couldn't have been any better!!!! Paul was the perfect host, super accommodating, the location was great and even his other guest we're hospitable, overall, 10 out of 10 for me, thanks again Paul!!!
->Paul is really generous and very kind. I had a very late check-in almost midnite and in between it keeps delaying and Paul seems not irritated and cool with it. The place is really close to KingCross St Prancras. Once you know the shortcut it will be about 5 minutes walk. Once arrived, called Paul, see him in person, very friendly and nice guy. The unit is very nice with modern interior design. He welcome me with beers and help to carry the baggage to 2nd floor. He introduced me his mother-in-law, gf and room mates. He prepared the guides, wifi and given the keys. The area is gated environment. I've walked back at midnite and there's no worries on the neighborhood. The listings description is very accurate. Very fast internet approx 30mbps. You able to use washing machines. You can grab yourself anything you like in the fridge.  Paul prepared me a foamburst body wash which is very cool. You must try it. This is my first time using airbnb service and I am very glad that I had chosen to stay in Paul's unit. 
->We needed a clean affordable place for a night near to St Pancras/King's Cross station. Paul's place checked all our boxes. <br/>We also sent Paul an urgent message a day before arriving asking if towels will be provided and we're really happy that it was and he included shower gel too. How thoughtful! <br/>We didn't meet Paul but met the other guests. We're well taken care off.<br/>Overall, we concur with everybody's review and really happy we stayed here
->Paul was an excellent host very friendly, accommodating and ensured there was breakfast and beer available for guests. Whilst I don't drink the very fact that Paul went the extra mile to make you feel at home was great. I cannot say enough about his hospitality he even made sure my car was secure by directing me to a visitors space in his complex. The property is an excellent location very central and close to King Cross, Camden and within easy access to the West End. Overall I have no hesitation in recommending you book a stay at Paul's place you will not be disappointed. Great host.  
->Paul was an amazing host, very friendly, accommodating. He ensured breakfast was available, and beers always fresh. I was happy to talk about trips, music or London places to visit with him. <br/><br/>Overall I strongly recommend you book a stay at Paul's place. The best host ever !<br/>
->This was my second stay with Paul, and once again I enjoyed being there.  The location is super convenient fro the Kings Cross-St Pancras hub; shopping areas are nearby; and the house is wonderful.  Paul is an excellent host, ready to share chat and a drink if you want, but will leave you be if you want when he's around.  Breakfast materials are abundant!  The large double has a table and chairs perfect for using a laptop, and a very big closet, so storage is no problem.  Paul is a living compendium of Whoviana--ask him anything about the program!  I will definitely stay with Paul on future trips.
->Paul was an awesome host! He was very kind and very helpfull. The appartment was very clean and in a quiet neighborhood. Very close of Kings Cross/St. Pancras (Eurostar) and the other attractions of the city. We definitely recommend this room for a trip in the beautiful London city.

->Carlos was lovely in arranging everything for my arrival. I had to get there early in the morning and he organised everything accordingly, for me to find the room ready and the keys. I was also able to leave my luggage there until the following evening when I had to leave quite late, without having to check out. The room is lovely, the bed is comfortable, and the location is perfect.
->I had a lovely two days stay at Carlos' place. The area couldn't be more perfect. You're right around the corner from the British Museum. The room itself is lovely and the shower is wonderful. I would definitely come back again.

->Patsy was a great host, very welcoming and we had excellent communication before and during my stay.  Her place is in a brilliant location, in a safe and central part of London and very close to tube, shops and restaurants.  I had a comfortable night and would happily recommend. 
->Great central location. Plenty of restaurants and places to buy food just a few steps away. Communication with Patsy was very good and she gave me lots of information about the neighbourhood. Nice room with comfy bed and tv. Great shower. Would stay there again.
->Felt comfortable and relaxed straight away because room is lovely in a lovely place (peaceful) but more importantly because Patsy is a thoughtful host who took care to make me feel at home - as well as giving the benefit of her real local knowledge.
->My stay at Patsy's place was, for me, what Airbnb is all about.   Efficient, economic, friendly, clean, tidy, comfortable and close to where I needed to be.  Patsy accommodated me at last minute and went out of her way to make sure I had what I needed.   Yes, I would certainly stay here again.
->I had a wonderful stay with Patsy and Alfie. Made very welcome with tea on arrival. As I didn't know London well she helped me with directions, even walking me to my meeting place the next day. The room was comfortable, clean and stylishly put together. I certainly will be back and for longer next time.
->I enjoyed my stay at Patsy's. She is a gracious host and kept good communication with me. My room was charming, quiet, and in a good location. I walked there from St. Pancras Eurostar station. Her dog, Alfie, is a sweetheart. I would stay there again.
->Patsy is a lovely host, very helpful. The room was very comfortable and nicely finished.
->Patsy is a very welcoming and accommodating host. Her home is as described, large, comfortable and incredibly well situated for any purpose in London. And even though downtown, it is exceptionally quiet. Just ideal!
->Patsy's place is in a fantastic location for anyone who needs to be near the British Library, British Museum, King's Cross, or St. Pancras. It's by many restaurants and pubs in Brunswick Square, and by one of the nicest supermarkets in London. The apartment is on the top floor of a Victorian building, and the amenities are comfortable. I didn't use the kitchen at all, but did use the washing machine once during my short stay. Patsy is particular about the schedule and noise made in the house late at night, so you should plan with that in mind.  
->Enjoyed my stay,felt very relaxed. Patsy was very friendly and welcoming. Alfie the dog was no bother ar all. Great location too,short walk from kings x station. Would stay there again
