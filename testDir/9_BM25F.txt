->Nina's place was just what I needed. <br/>You get a very small and basic room on the ground floor but it's clean and comfy - smells nice because of the little air freshener too.<br/>Soap, shampoo and moisturiser was an excellent touch - wouldn't expect that at this price range!<br/>Can't complain at all for the price and Nina was lovely. Would definitely recommend!

->Clean, private, and affordable room.  Very close to train station. It was perfect for the weekend!

->It was a good location close to Seven Sisters Station, bus, railway transport, and Victoria line convenient to the city centre, especially travelling from Stansted Airport. The basic room was small, clean and you could have a view from a roof window. Nina was friendly and sweet. One of the most important things, which the price was inexpensive.

->Good location for a great price. Nice size room and thoughtful little touches to make you feel at home
->Jacobs room was exactly how he described it. He is a extremely nice guy and we felt super welcomed. It’s absolutely the right place if you don’t expect anything fancy, because you will get something real and lovely. I would recommend this place and definitely come again (but if you are picky and searching for something in a nice and clean tourist area it’s probably not the right place to stay). Here you get a small room with toilet, external and okay shower, a super helpful and nice contact, an authentic stay in a not wealthy London area.
->Jacob was a sympatic host. He offered us to show us around and provided few city guide books of London. The room witch an attached toilet was clean and comfortable. We had access to a shared kitchen and shower. The location is quite nice. Close to few restaurants, supermarkets and a small but nice park.
->A nice atmospheric place in an old nursing home that has been taken over by artistic types. Jacob has a nice idea about making this into a proper communal space. Great price for the location, a really comfy bed and Jacob is a really nice guy.
->We had a great stay in Jacob’s place! Very quirky building, clean and good location. Super value for money and Jacob was very responsive, he was very flexible with check-in and check-out times. Would book to stay here again.
->A very comfortable room with everything I need. People around the building all are very nice and lovely. That's a good place for single young man to stay.
->Great host! He is very helpful in every situation and very flexible on check-in time. What is more, he responds immediately! I really recommend his place, people around are kind, the location is very convenient and the area is enjoyable.
->Perfect host! Jacob is keen to give any tips for your trip and help with any issue in case you have. I loved the room. It has an artistic touch which I like. Highly recommended.

->We had a confortable stay during our stay.very quiet area and short drive to city centre.the house is undergoing Rénovation wich i am sûr it will make it more pleasant<br/>The owner of the house were very nice and friendly and  welcomed us warmly .<br/>The price is reasonable compare to hotel prices in london at this time
->Host very welcoming, and helpful when needed.  Listing doesn't however mention a few important details.  This house is not smoke free, which we were not made aware of.  Due to health issues, this made our stay quite uncomfortable, and we would not have chosen it, if we had known.  There is currently significant re-modelling going on within the house, so there is no bathroom easily accessible with this room, as of yet.  Beds comfortable, bedroom clean.  No closets or storage within this bedroom.  Also, breakfast not included in price, additional cost.  Parking spaces along road side.
->Virginett is an excellent host, really enjoyed my stay at their house. Thank you for your well received hospitality. 
->V této rodině jsme strávily měsíc ve 4 lidech. Ihned po příjezdu nás majitelé domu vřele uvítali a zběžně nám ukázali dům. Náš pokoj byl pěkný, neb proč čtyři osoby velmi malý a stísněný. Je vybavený dvěmi dvoupatrovými postelemi, menší komodou a zrcadlem. Bohužel nám nebylo předem oznámeno, že v domě bude probíhat rekonstrukce, čímž bylo ovlivněno okolí domu. Interiér, který byl často zaprášený a pro jedince, kteří mají rádi svůj klid je tato rodina spíše nevhodná, neboť je poměrně hlučná a to i v pozdních nočních hodinách. Rodina bydlí v multikulturní čtvrti s veškerou občanskou vybaveností.
->De buurt was goed. Ontvangst was erg vriendelijk. We moesten onze schoenen buiten laten. Dit vonden we niet leuk. Er was nog steeds een verbouwing gaande. Douche konden we niet gebruiken. Jammer. Wc en badmeubel waren niet schoon en stofvrij gemaakt. Bedden waren niet goed in elkaar gezet en piepten en kraakten vreselijk. Erg kleine kamer voor 4 personen. 3x3 meter. Geen tafel of stoel om je kleren op te leggen. Geen gordijn voor het raam. Erg slecht allemaal. Ontbijt was voor 4 pond per persoon erg minimaal. Alleen geroosterde toast met jam of honing of pasta en cornflakes. Met thee of koffie.
->It was everything fine, Virginett and her husband very polite, and very friendly.<br/>The room it was clean and the beds good to sleep, the bathroom great,  just 5 min walk from de bus station, and 10 min by bus from the underground.<br/>There are too many shops in the center, and supermarkets.<br/>I recommend the house!
->Virginett and her family was very nice, helpful and welcoming. The room was as descripted and perfectly corresponded to my expectations with comfortable beds and a really nice bathroom on the same floor.<br/>My friends and I really enjoyed our stay and would gladly recommend Virginett as a host.<br/>Thanks again for welcomming us !
->Virginett and her family were really nice and welcoming, they made you feel like you were at home. The house was clean and comfortable. They were always ready to help and give advices. Their daughter was very nice and very helpful. The room, bathroom and kitchen are different from the pictures... they've renewed it and it's really nice and modern. Their back yard is also very nice. It was a really nice stay. Thank you!
->It was my right decision to choose Virginett's place to stay. I was here along with my spouse and two kids and everyone was very comfortable and happy. We have been guided very accurately and all of our queries were immediately resolved without any time gap before and after our check-in. <br/>It was very pleasant stay we had and many thanks to Suresh and Virginett for making us home like feeling. We found this place is more convenient for commute to central London. We have all the reasons here to choose this option when we travel back to London. Thanks again!
->Our hosts made us feel very welcome and were interested in what we were up to in London. The room was cosy and the beds comfortable (if rather squeaky!) but perhaps not the cleanest. There was a fridge for our use and access to the kitchen. <br/><br/>You get what you pay for: a nice room to stay in with a friendly family at a relatively affordable price.

REVIEWS:

->The room is very nice, clean, bright and cosy. It was perfect for my short stay, Ming made me feel like at home, the room has a very useful desk and a big wardrobe (plenty of towels provided). The flat is extremely clean. Plenty of space in the fridges and the kitchen has got all needed cooking facilities, the house has got 2-3 toilets and 2 showers. It was everything so clean and very comfortable. It is a great value for money. Definitely recommended.
->Perfect house for a short or long stay, the landlord Ming is really sympathetic and kind. All the facilities are included and a good place to make new friends. Easy way to get transport, supermarket, and also some leisure places, such as the Horniman Museum and Gardens. For sure I recommend Ming's home!!!
->Ming's place is excellent for those who are trying to relocate to London, as the whole house is filled with people staying for an extended period of time (typically 7 days or more). Because of this, if you also stay for a longer time, you get to know the other house guests as well as Ming because the kitchen is, obviously, a common area. It's a really cool experience as, when I was here, it was very international. The house is also very close to a bus stop with at least three different bus routes, and Forest Hill station (Overground + National Rail Service) is a 10-12 minute walk away, depending on your pace. The only time I was a bit uncomfortable was walking home late at night, as the last couple of steps are poorly lit.<br/>This room is on the third floor, and shares a toilet and washroom with two other rooms on this level. The windows are huge and both open, and allow ample air circulation. The neighbourhood itself can be noisy at times, whether it's sirens or alarms, people playing music very loudly at strange times (I was woken up at 6am on a Saturday due to Adele remixes from the neighbours) or kids playing. This is fine so long as you either close the windows and/or have earplugs! <br/>Ming was also very accommodating. I gave myself about 10 days to find a room to live in which, unsurprisingly, was not enough. With Ming's help, I was able to quickly sort out alternative arrangements. <br/>I really cannot recommend this place enough!
->Ming apartment is a perfect place for the London visitors. It is easily accessible by public transportations. As there are more rooms, chance to meet some cool traveler is high. Communication was really easy. Value for money!
->Great experience!<br/>I went to London in september, and I'd lived one month in Ming's house. Mr Ming is a kind person, he has welcomed me when I was arrived, he has helped me with bagages because I'v rented a second floor room! <br/>Mr Ming provide necessary things, the kitchen are full of accessories to cook, there is a wash machine, and dishes machine, and if you want you can cook with microwave, also there is a shelf with a lots of intresting books, in the house there is an iron, a hair dryer.<br/>The house is very big, near the rail station (Forest Hill, overground orange line), and near the bus stop to Victoria station (line 185), and Crystal Palace (line 122). <br/>Near the house there are a lot of supermarkets, restaurants, pubs, and a museum... etc. <br/>There is a bathroom on the Ground floor, and one in the second floor. The kitchen is very big, and there is a room that you can use to dry your clothes, normally is a living room.  <br/>In the house generally live 5 persons, Mr Ming live in the first floor where there is a room to rent, I'd lived in the second floor where there were three rooms. My room was confortable, with a big window, with a big window on the garden, that you can me use during the beautiful days. <br/>I think that the house is perfect for a long stay or less, and if I had will return in London, I will choose Ming's house!<br/>Thank you!
->Ming is very nice and helpful. All went well and smooth. I enjoyed my stay in this home a lot. Recommended!
->A very clean and cozy cozy place to rest, two nearby stations and Ming makes it a very pleasant hospitality.  highly recommended
->Ming’s place is a delight. Cozy, clean, with the most friendly landlord I have ever met. Ming always greets you with a smile, we chatted like long-met friends. I won’t hesitate to recommend this stay to anyone who looks for a home experience in SE23.
->Very clean house. Ming is amazing host and takes a lot of care of the house. A great value for money - I definitely recommend this place
->Mr. Ming is a really warm person and he is willing to help in every way he can. In general the place is good, but the cookware is not well taken care of. Apart from that the place and hospitality is great.

REVIEWS:

->Gareth is very accommodating. Close to transit as well.
->All good, cute suburban area with shops and perfect underground connection. All you need for a weekend in London!
->This room was suitable enough for my needs and the check-in/check out process was super straightforward. I only wish that there was some AC or a fan available to the guests, as it got super hot and stuffy in the room even with the windows open.
->Nice studio and comfy. It could have been better cleaned.
->Everything was great. The room was clean, quiet and really comfortable. The location was really close to the tube station and there were shops and restaurans close by. Gareth was quick to reply and provided us with an iron and extra towels upon request.
->nice flat
->Cozy and quiet place to stay. Great location.
->The place was inviting, clean, and cozy and it was exactly as it was portrayed in the photos.  The location is very good.  There are lots of nice restaurants/cafes nearby and it's very pleasant to walk along Walm Lane, and it's very close to the metro so there's easy access to the rest of London.  Also it's in a quiet residential neighborhood so there's barely any noise at night.  I don't really have any complaints.  I would highly recommend it for anyone who's looking for a small, affordable place with easy access to the city.
->The room is lovely and clean, everything is great! Recommend!
->Tudo certo, estação próxima, anfitrião prestativo, ferro de passar roupa disponível me senti muito confortável! Obrigado.

REVIEWS:

->Virginett and her husband were very friendly and accommodating. The listing is fairly accurate with a few renovations in their house. The neighbourhood is quiet and friendly. I had one of the best home cooked meals and it was free. I loved the family vibe and I hope to come and see you again.
->Mrs. Virginette was very warm and welcoming when we first met her.The room was very clean and spacious enough for two people. At first when we moved in to the house we couldn't meet Mrs. Virginitte but her kids welcomed us very well and explained everything even about reaching to city center efficiently.<br/>The family was very kind and always offered us to have tea or dinner with them.<br/>The place is 20-25 mins from the center and would recommend it highly.
->We stayed for 2 nights with the family. Our room was fine and the hosts were warm, friendly and most helpful. Renovations were in progress. Access to city is about 30 mins by bus and rail.
->I can not recommend Virginett and her family enough. They welcomed us into their home despite it being after 3am when we arrived. The room was clean and the bed I slept in was comfortable. <br/>Having our own key to the house was a blessings, as we could come and go as we pleased. Virginett even lent us her Oyster card for a night after my partner lost his. <br/>There are renovations happening at the moment. The kitchen pictured in the add is now brand new kitchen and many other improvements are on the way. This house will keep getting better and better!<br/>The house is a bit out of the city. But there is a bus stop at the end of the street which takes you straight to an underground train station that will take you into the city. For travelers on a budget, it's worth traveling a little bit every day and pay less than 1/2 the amount of a backpacker dorm room.<br/>If we are coming back to London, we would stay again for sure.<br/>Thanks for hosting us!!!
->We were welcomed very warm and friendly. The room was nice and cosy even though it wasn't as described<br/> since they had some renovations going on. The neighbourhood is nice and quiet and is very easily accessible.
->I had a nice time staying with Virginette.  Unfortunately, we were only there for two nights and our schedules never really seemed to match so we didn't get to spend any time together.  Her kids met us at the door after a few knocks and we had the opportunity to talk to her husband briefly before we left.  He explained that they were in the middle of construction.  Everyone was nice.  There are a few places to get something to eat in walking distance (the Chinese take away was good), or you can hop on the bus and see a few sights.
->Virginett seemed very nice.<br/>The room, however was not. The description did not match the actual. It was a very basic room and 'triple deluxe room' was in fact 2 bunk beds and a single at a higher price that I have paid for other rooms.<br/>I did not expect a single bed. There wasn't a TV in the room, no comforts at all and realistically it was a disgrace.<br/>The house is going through a re-decoration/renovation and the picture on the website is of their front room, which you don't get to see.<br/>There wasn't any option for cooking and the family started their evening meal at 10pm, so all the smells filtered up through the floorboards into my bedroom, along with cigarette smoke.<br/>The family constantly raised their voices to each other and stopped me from sleeping.<br/>The area itself is disgusting with rubbish and debris littering the street allowing vermin to eat from the food bags left on the street.<br/>I saw a fox and a rat in the week I was there.<br/>Incidentally, I had to park 2/300 meters away from the property at night.<br/>Overall a very unhappy experience. One which I wouldn't care to repeat.<br/>No issues with her.
->nice spacious room and nice host. not far from city centre via public transportation.
->The hosts were lovely, the only drawback was the bathroom in which the toilet didn't flush but we understand that was a temporary thing! 
->Very nice people and very welcoming. Would recommend to people coming through.

REVIEWS:

->I could not be more thankful for a great experience with this family. It was my first time using air bnb and absolutely thank my host for making me feel right at home. They were helpful from the time I entered the door until I left. If I'm ever in London again I'm definitely staying with them again! 
->Virginett's house was undergoing decoration but I was welcomed properly.<br/>i had a good chat with her husband on the final day and he kindly drove me to the bus stop, saving me from a 16 minute walk with a heavy bag.
->I had a very pleasant stay - Virginett and her family were very nice and helpful, the room was good. Thank you very much for welcoming me!
->I am so grateful to Virginett and her family. It was a last minute request and they were gracious enough to accept my booking.<br/>Their location was great for where I needed to travel to [I was heading to Kingston University], and is generally easy to get to. Virginett was also kind enough tot stay up and chat with me until 1 am Saturday! I really enjoyed the conversation; chats like these are the most enjoyable. <br/><br/>They're a family of musicians and dancers, of which I did not know until after I arrived. I'll stay longer next time. Hopefully then I'll be able to chat more about the arts and culture, and listen to the family play.<br/><br/>The room was exactly as you see it in the picture, and the house is spacious.
->HOST:<br/><br/>Virginett and her entire family are incredibly warm and friendly people. I only stayed for a couple of nights while my permanent residence was being prepared, but they were very sweet to me during that time. They were eager to help with information on the surrounding area, letting me know the location of close-by routes and amenities. They made me feel at home the moment I walked through the door - they're just lovely friendly people.<br/><br/>THE ROOM: <br/><br/>Is as pictured. It's actually slightly bigger in person than it seems to be in the photo. It was very warm and comfortable and very clean. Peaceful street meant a well needed good night's rest.<br/><br/>The AREA:<br/><br/>Being a quiet neighbourhood down in Mitcham, there's limited choice for eating/shopping in the surrounding area. But it's London - everything is just a quick transit ride away. I enjoy walks and made it to Streatham in about 30mins walking. Otherwise there's frequent buses that can get you to Tooting Broadway in about 20mins.<br/><br/>Everything about this place is great! The two things that strike out are the incredibly warm and welcoming family (made me a little less homesick) and the insanely cheap  price for the room. I was so happy they took me on with such short notice. Peaceful, peaceful stay.<br/><br/>Thanks to the entire family!
->2週間の滞在でした。<br/>彼らはとても親切なご家族です。<br/>彼らの国の伝統の料理「ストリングホッパー」(米粉で作られた麺をスパイシーな数種の野菜ソースでからめて食べる、もちろん手で食べる料理)をごちそうしてくださいました。<br/>部屋は思ったよりも大きくて、すこし独特の匂いがしましたが、ほとんど快適に過ごせました。<br/>特に、お父さんは非常に親切で心優しい方です。会うたびに、「Hello,Koki! How are you!」と声をかけて、世間話やさまざまな必要な情報を与えてくれました。<br/>また、頼んだらキッチンや机なども貸してくださり、不自由なく過ごせました。Wi-Fiもすべての部屋に届いています。<br/>近くにco-operativeのスーパーマーケットがあり、夜でもそこそこ遅くまでやってるので、食材はそこで安く買って調理しました。<br/>バス停からも徒歩3分ほど。<br/>素敵なロンドンライフをありがとうございました。<br/>I stayed in this room for 2 weeks.<br/>They are very kind family. They served me a dinner, string hoppers(which is the noodle with spicy vegetable sauce. the noodle is made of rice powder and tastes very very nice. it is the traditional dinner in their country).<br/>The room is larger than I thought, and I spend comfortable time.<br/>And they let me use kitchen and desk to use my RapTop.<br/>Wi-Fi is the service also you can use.<br/>And a co-operative supermarket is near by this house so that I could buy some foods to cook in the kitchen.<br/>Bus stop is near by here, just 3 minutes by walk.<br/>Thank you for very nice London Life, Virginet Family.<br/>(I'm sorry that my very poor English ability. I didn't use the Translation App.)
->Virginett and her family were absolutely amazing! She helped me plan transportation to and from the airport, and was more than welcoming during my entire stay! I even had an issue with my flight and had to stay another night and they took me in free of charge! Like a home away from home! Very easy to get into London from this location and Virginett is very quick to respond to any questions or concerns. Highly recommend to anyone planning a trip to London!
->It's always a pleasure staying with Virginett and her family.
->I have stayed with Virginett and I would definitely recommend her to others.
->I had a very pleasant stay for a fair price. The family were very welcoming and I would recommend staying with Virginett if in London for any reason.

REVIEWS:

->L'alloggio è davvero vicinissimo alla stazione di bermondsey sulla jubilee, il che la rende facilmente accessibile a tutto, ovunque vogliate andare sarete a pochissimi minuti di metro ;) il quartiere è tranquillo e molto pratico, di fianco ha un fish&chips, di fronte un ristorante take away, e più supermercati a basso prezzo nei paraggi, le ragazze, lasciano casa al mattino e rientrano la sera, quindi si possono usare sia la doccia che la cucina con comodità. Sono ragazze inglesi e giovani, quindi non proprio ordinate, ma vi accorgerete che vivono un po' tutti così lì, quindi non aspettatevi un albergo,ma sono molto disponibili, sia a consigli su cosa fare, sia se vi manca qualcosa come il phon, o simili, nel complesso siamo stati bene.
