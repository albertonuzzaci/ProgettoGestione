REVIEWS:

->Great location, stylish space, communicative host. Great stay.
->Andrea's home is a beautiful apartment in a nice, quiet neighborhood. The home is just as pictured with a lovely balcony to sit outside and enjoy the fresh air. <br/>The check in was perfect and extremely easy by getting the key from a lock box just a couple of feet from the apartment. The apartment was perfectly cleaned with plenty of comforts for cooking your own meals and a grocery store less than 2 minutes away walking. <br/>You are also walking distance to tons of great restaurants and pubs! Would 100% stay here again!
->Fantastic stay.. apartment clean and very quirky. Host was brilliant and very helpful with any questions.
->Andrea's listing was a great choice for a homely comfort stay over holidays amidst the lockdown restrictions as we majorly had to stay indoors during the length of our entire stay. It was an extremely home-like, comfortable and cozy stay with a lot of accessories and tools available at our disposal for daily use at the apartment. Tesco and few local shops are a few steps away making it an excellent choice for accessing basic necessities. Andrea was extremely generous and was available to assist us with any queries we had. Overall it was an extremely enjoyable, warm and a pleasant experience.

->Great location in Walthamstow. Easy access to bus, train, Underground, shopping, pubs, and groceries. Friendly and accommodating host. Will use again next time I’m in London.
->I booked this room for my dad when he came to visit from Italy and he really liked staying at Martin’s place. The communication was great from the beginning and Martin was very accommodating. The room was spacious and clean and the en-suite bathroom added even more privacy. I highly recommend staying here, I’ll definitely book again!
->Loved this cosy place so much! Martin is an incredible host and my 2 week stay flew by. Would highly recommend staying here when in London. Thank you for everything, Martin!
->Martin is an amazing host. He was very helpful and attentive and it was such a friendly atmosphere in his house. <br/>I liked my room and a private bathroom made it quite private. I wfh and it was comfy to work from the place because there was a workplace.<br/>The area is lovely. There is a park nearby, nice cafes. <br/>Overall, I loved my stay. Thank you, Martin!
->I really enjoyed the 5 days I spent at Martin's place. Martin offers a lovely warm welcome and is a generous and friendly host. I felt really relaxed and at home. The room was much larger than I expected for London. It's clean,  bright and airy with a modern ensuite. The room is equipped with a TV with Netflix and Amazon prime. The bed is really comfortable and the location is peaceful. Well located for a walk to the nearest tube and a short distance from the William Morris museum and beautiful surrounding parkland. The only thing to note for anyone with mobility issues is the two flights of stairs to the room. I can highly recommend this accommodation which represents great value for money and its cool host Martin. I hope to return.
->Comfortable stay. Very kind host.
->Martin has been a great host. He has been very responsive to my messages. I had a two-month stay in his property and felt very at home. His place is close to both underground and over ground stations, which is about 30min to King’s Cross. The room is spacious and have everything you need. I really enjoyed chatting with Martin after work in the evenings too. All in all a great experience. Highly recommended!

REVIEWS:

->Jos is place is exactly as it looks. <br/>Great location and a great self-serve studio in Leyton that has everything you need (stove, cookware, kettle, toaster etc).<br/>Would definitely stay again.
->Worst experience, too many cons in this place, I will not recommend it. <br/>There is no heating facility available in this place. When asked the host mentioned there is no need for heating. However the temperature outside was close to 3 degree. If I would have known anything about this I wouldn't have made such a booking.<br/>The place was stinking to the worst it can.<br/>The utensils were stinking. Oven was dirty and couldn't be used. <br/>Washing machine is not working.<br/>The whole place is shabby and stinks in total, to cover this up the host put extra perfumes with strong smells which can even burn your nose hair and cause serious allergy and breathing problems.<br/>The kitchen wasn't cleaned properly.<br/>There were only one bulb working in each kitchen and bedroom. Making the place more depressing.<br/>The bed is so small it can not accommodate more than one person.<br/> <br/>The place looks more like a cheap hostel. <br/>First impression of the host was between a bad and good communicator. I have tried to contact him to get more details in advance so that I can get myself ready. However he was a bit rude on his first answer and then later he sent a full communication regarding the way to get access to the place. <br/>14 nights and surprisingly only one bedding set. <br/>You can easily hear the noise from next door (neighbor, shower room or living room, bedroom) due to poor construction making us uncomfortable to freely walk around to avoid disturbing other guests.<br/>The heater is a controlled system by the host. Not being able to warm up the place when it is cold or turn off the heater when it’s hot, that was very annoying and uncomfortable. We had times of being in a cold until the host switched on the heater <br/>Poor water pressure in both kitchen and bathroom, you can be having a shower or washing the dishes then water will suddenly stop running for a few minutes. <br/>There is a camera operating in the main entrance but the host never mentioned it, so you will be recorded without your consent when you are coming in
->Jos place offers almost everything you want in a place. It is just outside the central london, and Central Line takes you there in 30 mins (10 mins walk + 20 mins tube). The place has all the essentials- kitchen utensils, cleaning necessities, kettle, table and chairs. Jos was also kind enough to give us an extra chair when requested. The only thing I'd say is that some people may find the room and bathroom size a bit small (depends on where you are coming from). We were 2 people and we found the bed size a bit small. The sofa cum Bed helped a lot. However, that meant almsot no floor space when you have the sofa open. <br/>I'd say- for 1 person- this is a great place with this price.

->This is a very nice place to stay (if you like cats). It's quiet around the house, and lots of buses if you want to get around. If it's your first stay in London I probably would have stayed closer to a tube-station, but for me who wanted to explore new areas of the city it was really good. There's lot's of nice walks in the area, stores and restaurants within 15 mins walk. Bex is a very kind host.

There is also a supermarket nearby and you can use the full-equiped kitchen and bathroom. It's like in the pictures. The only thing that we'd like to mention is that there were smokers in the apartment, so bear that in mind. Apart from that, Kate and Nick (who received us) were really kind and always willing to help. We had a good time there!
->The room was very clean and very comfortable. It had Christmas decorations which we thought was a nice detail. There were also towels, disposable sandals and soap available for us. The shared bathroom was also maintained clean at all times. We felt comfortable and even if the house is far from the centre of London, it is a good place to rest after long days walking.
->Lovely bedroom, amazing bed..really enjoyed my space.. thank you Kate..

->What a lovely house to stay in, Ade and Iban were great hosts and very responsive if I had any queries no matter how small. They gave me some excellent local knowledge, which was very useful. The room is beautifully decorated and very clean. I would definitively come back soon to play with the cats.
->Adeline was a lovely host and has a beautiful home! Adeline kindly purchased us two beers from a local brewery & gave us lots of local recommendations. The house is very stylish & the balcony was a great sun spot to have a few drinks on.<br/>The area is beautiful too, with a canal that makes a good running / cycling spot.<br/>Thoroughly enjoyed our trip & would highly recommend Adeline’s place.
->Adeline und Iban sind die perfekten Gastgeber. Es hat Spaß gemacht, sich mit ihnen zu unterhalten und die saubere und gepflegte Wohnung mit ihnen zu teilen. <br/>In der direkten Nähe gibt es viele hippe Lokale. Frühstück gibt es gleich in der Nähe, ca. 100 m. Die Overground ist auch in der Nähe, 10 min. zu Fuss. <br/>Wir kommen auf jeden Fall wieder.<br/>Liebe Grüße an die süßen neugierigen Katzen.

->‘Twas nice.
->Great location and lovely host.
->Hasan and Ozzy are really kind and helped a lot. Hasan replied really fast after I found the password to enter is not correct. He also put a desk and a chair in the room really fast after I found there was none but I need them for the online class. The internet problem was solved very fast as well. <br/>The property is very close to Camden high street so convenient for grocery shopping, there are sainsbury, lidl and poundland around, as well as many restaurants. There are some cooking tools and ingredients in the kitchen so tenant can cook some simple food. Overall I found this staying quite peasant. Thank you Hasan！
->Nice and clean place. Very close to central London and Euston station.<br/>The host was very responsive. <br/>I would recommend this place if you want to visit London.
->Todo bien, el defecto era que en la litera de arriba habia meado de gato y olia toda la habitación a cuadra pero por el resto ok!!
->Great host, freat location
->Good location for staying in the Camden area
->I spent most of the day in the city, just came back to take a shower and sleep, and I'm very happy. Perfect location, 3 minutes from the underground. I will gladly come back :)
->The flat is beautifully located in Camden and met our needs and expectations exactly - budget accommodation in London; guests need to be aware that the room is rather small and is in a shared house.
->Communication and check in was great as is the location but as is confirmed in the listing this is very much a budget accommodation suited just to sleeping in for perhaps one night. Bedding and towels seemed clean but smell quite stale and are well worn. Room had a strong strange smell - not sure if it was due to some damp/mould present. Bed is quite uncomfortable  and be aware that you could be disturbed by other people sharing the building.

->This is an ideal place to stay at a great price if you are visiting London. Its only a short bus ride and then tube journey to the centre of London which is around 30 minutes. The place itself is nice and cosy in a quiet area of North London, and the residents are very friendly and helpful, very laid back and they made us feel welcome. I would recommend this place for couples and travellers/tourists. Thank you Kirstie (and Anthony too) for being very friendly and helpful to us during our short stay.

REVIEWS:

->The flat is very nice, the bedroom is cosy and confortable. I really like the area where is located the flat, there is a bus stop in front of the flat with buses to the centre all the time aswell there is a supermarket Tesco. It is a really good place to spend few days in London.<br/>Shane wasn't in the flat during my stay but he is very kind and explain me everything about the flat.<br/>When we arrive to the flat Carl, Shane's flat mate, was there he is very helpful and kind. It is a really good place to spend, I recomnend it. My experience was fantastic.
->Comfortable and clean house, the room is exactly  as advertised - pretty large for a place in London - and well lacated !<br/>While I did not see Shane during my stay, he and his flatmate Carl were extremely friendly. Excellent place to stay!
->Shane was very hospitable, very welcoming and informed us on the best things to do in this area. Netlflix is on offer, without the chill, the location is fantastic, local cafes, bus stops outside the apartment block, train stations writhing 3-5 min walking distance.<br/>A 30 min walk into zone 1, 15 min walk to shoreditch & other great locations in East London nearby.<br/>The apartment is immaculate,  very clean, made us feel at home. <br/>Definitely recommend this place and would love to have stayed longer.<br/>

We never met Shane,but he was super helpful with all his messages. The flat was perfectly clean,it's very well located(!),and Shane's flatmate was really nice and friendly as well. Overall it's a great choice indeed,I would recommend it anytime!
->The room and the whole flat were clean, bed was comfortable. Shane’s housemate was here to show us the flat and was there when we needed any advice (e.g. restaurants).<br/>Actually, there’s not much to say - clean room, flat 2 mins from overground station and a nice roommate - for me that’s a perfect stay.
->The neighborhood was safe and very close to city transportation. What a great stay! His dog is so cute. It is a little loud to be close to the road though.
