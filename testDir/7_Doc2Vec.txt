->It was one of the best traveling trips we ever had. They are ol so kind. It is a beautiful place with beautiful people, you should stay there
->It was so good. Love to stay there. It was the second time we were staying at Anna’s home. So then you want to have a good and kind stay in London you should go there. It’s a awesome place with so much lovely people. We will come again. Hope to see you soon. :)
->Definitely reccomend. The hosts were beyond lovely. The house was very stylish and clean. Felt very safe and at home. Wish I could have stayed forever :)
->Anna's place is amazing. The loft is huge with lots of light with quirky and stylish decor. My room was huge and was more than I expected. There are lots of restaurants, pubs and great coffee shops in the area. Transport into Central London is very convenient. The hosts are the most welcoming and friendly people I have met.
->Amazing place with amazing people. Anna was a very kind host and very helpful. <br/>The flat is placed near to Clapton train station,so is very easy to connect with Liverpool street station.<br/>The zone is very beautiful also.<br/>Spanish:<br/>No tendría dudas en elegir este lugar para una estadía en Londres. El barrio tiene varios supermercados y parques al rededor, además de estar cerca del tren y varias líneas de colectivo.<br/>Durante los 10 días aprox. Que estuve no tuve ningún tipo de problema con la limpieza, privacidad ni nada parecido. <br/>Fue una muy linda experiencia compartir estos días con Anna, Cary y Stephen y espero que se repita!
->Best Airbnb we have stayed in. Great place and even better people. Can't recommend the place enough
->I was staying with Anna, Cary and Zarina, all of them are very nice creative people. If you'd like to explore both the creative hub of London - East London and the nature, this is the right place! The place is also very stylish and spacious, which is hard to find in London.
->We booked the place for one of our team. She was very happy with her stay and the host were very hospitable. She would definitely stay here again.
->Great place! Highly recommended!
->The space is exactly as shown in the listing - super clean, beautiful interior. Have nothing at all to complain about and would definitely recommend staying there.

REVIEWS:

->Rafael es un anfitrión encantador. Es muy agradable y siempre se muestra dispuesto a ayudar. El apartamento es tal y como se describe en el anuncio. Está muy bien ubicado. Sin duda, en caso de volver, repetiríamos la estancia en el apartamento de Rafael.
->Rafael is super easy going cool guy :D <br/>The place is what it is showed, area is a bit sketchy at night, but the flat is well for a stay in London. <br/>Accessible by metro very near and first necessity provided. And room very quiet.<br/>Good value ;)
->Rafael is an easygoing guy and the communication was excellent throughout. The room is just like in the description. Lively neighbourhood with an outdoor market on the same road. Nothing to complain about!
->Perfect pad for what I needed. Raphael was easy to deal with
->不錯的位置，高性價比，Rafael也很樂於助人，周圍的環境多樣，你可能見到一些怪怪的人，但是安全、熱鬧和正常。超市和車站也很近，你可以找到一切生活所需
->Rafael's place is just as it looks. The location's not the best, but he is a great host and the apartment is clean, the room is accurate as compares to the pictures, and Rafael as a host is super friendly and easy to communicate with.
->Very good value,  exactly as advertised
->A good option if you’re on a budget but still want good location. In the middle of dalston market and lots around the area.
->Communication was easy and the lockbox was easily located with photos. The room itself was clean. The front door key however was difficult and took a few tries to open each time as the door was quiet flimsy. You also had to lock it after you and in the event of a fire would have been difficult to exit quickly. The room itself is the hosts room and he stays on a sofa bed with a partition in the shared living area. I know that this is how some airbnbs are, but I do not feel that this was made clear in the description and we may not have booked it had we known. There was a lock on the outside of the door to the bedroom for when you leave but no lock on the inside. This did not feel safe and had I been a lone female traveller would have felt more comfortable if there was a lock on the inside for when sleeping, and if I couldn't be locked in from the outside. The surrounding area isn't great either so again probably isn't ideal if you were a single female. <br/>In general, if you need just a bed to sleep in for the night it is a cheap stay in London and the room is clean and towels were provided. Otherwise the advert needs to be clearer on the set up and I felt it doesn't meet the basic standards I would expect from an airbnb.
->Rafael is a very nice host. Great communication.

->Much nicer place than what I thought it would be. Clean and safe gated neighbourhood. Bed was comfy and Nicole and Ivan wete friendly and laidback hosts. Perfect for a quick place to crash after a night out in London. Highly recommended.
->A lovely house in a cool (but calm) neighbourhood, with a big bedroom towards a garden, two bathrooms and a nice kitchen. We could both wander around the area exploring cafés and local shops, or easily use public transport to get into town. Nicole and Ivan were generous and friendly hosts, we especially appreciated a pretty late check-in. However, the house should be cleaner than what it was for our stay. Thanks for having us!
->Nicole and Ivan were very friendly and accommodating.  Great hosts :) The room was comfortable and the surrounding area is very nice. Lots of nice restaurants and cafes. It's close by public transport as well.

->Carmen and her family were perfect hosts, and I had a great time staying at their place in London. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again the next time I'm in town! <br/><br/>-Michael
->Ce fut PARFAIT!<br/>Carmen et Volker nous ont accueillis chaleureusement dans leur grand appartement de standind au coeur de Londres.<br/>Propreté, renseignements tout a été génial.<br/>Merci à eux pour ce week-end top.<br/>A recommander 100000 fois!
->Himari, our baby son and I had a wonderful stay in Carmens and Volkers place. Really modern, elegant, spacy, clean and in a good place to find your way to any place in the city - in other words: very central. The next station is 3 minutes away and there are lots of interesting cultural places. However, the best was the friendly attitude of Volker (unfortunately Carmen was abroad) who even prepared a baby bed for our son. On top of that he had arranged nappies and baby ointment since he knows what babies need because of his own kids. We were happy to use their spacious kitchen which was well organized and had anything needed for breakfast! At the end of our time we celebrated our stay in a local restaurant! Definitely recommended! 
->My stay with Carmen & Volker was my first Air B&B experience and it was amazing. My hosts were welcoming, friendly and relaxed while making sure that I was happy and had everything I needed during  my stay. My room in their beautiful apartment was perfect and I felt completely at home and treated to lots of nice things for breakfast. The location in Dalston is perfect for anybody who wants to experience East London and easy access to all areas of the city via the new Dalston train service. I stayed for work and I would 100% recommend the apartment and hope to have the opportunity to stay there again. 
->Exactly like the description. Exactement comme sur les photos et le descriptif ! comme à l'Hotel, à une minute à pied du métro et des bus. Expérience incroyable pour un prix modique. Merci
->I enjoy staying at Carmen's home, it's comfortable place and close to overground station.  You can help youself for the breakfast with coffee and tea.  The house is nice and clean. Thanks for Carmen and her family especially two lovely kids.  They gave me lots of advice for my sight-seeing in London.
->Carmen and her family are all lovely people. She is really nice to me and prepared a lot of food in the fridge for me to eat anytime incase i'm hungry in the middle of the night. Her kids are also lovely and cute.<br/><br/>The room is really good. It's so spacious and the bed was great. You also got your own bathroom during the stay. The apartment is just right besides the overground station. Its really easy to get access to any place in London. <br/><br/>I'd love to stay in Carmen's place once again if i ever have a chance to visit london again! :)
->Carmen's descriptions were part of the reason I chose to stay at her place.  Besides the appeal at the type of accommodations she was offering, the nuances in her writing suggested to me that these were honest and detail-oriented people.  Indeed they are honest, perceptively accommodating, and friendly people to boot!   My husband and I had a lovely stay in London, thanks in part to our eager hosts.  Everything is very clean and inviting.  The bed is wonderfully comfortable.  And the offerings at breakfast in the living space are delightful.  Carmen and Volker are comfortable to be around.  They will sit and chat with you, and help you figure your way in London, or they will give you your space and privacy.  ...  This was our airbnb trial and in certain ways, it beats the hotel experience.  Now we feel like we have friends in London.  :-)
->This was the best Airbnb experience so far! Carmen and her family were extremely nice and thoughtful. Room was perfectly prepared. Amazing separate bathroom (with fresh towels every morning), full breakfast, any imaginable snacks etc — every tiny detail was already considered, so we just felt us at home. Gorgeous apartment as well as the building and area itself... Well, this is just the finest Airbnb representation! 
->It was my first experience in airbnb. Excellent housting for my mum and sister.<br/>Carmen, Volker  and their children are welcoming, friendly and warm people. Carmen is really nice, funny and considered. <br/>My Mum and sister didn´t have any problem communicating with them  even though my family didn´t speak any english. (there were some funny situation)<br/>They made us feel at home, in confidence.<br/>My family really enjoyed and rested very confortably there, in a beautiful room with batroom (fresh towels every day) The flat is clean,spacious and brightly.<br/>The Location is perfect and easy acces to all areas of the city.<br/>100% recommend

->Our flight was delayed and our luggage was left in Abu Dhabi, and with no data or wifi we struggled getting into contact with our hosts until late in the evening. Janine, though, was still incredibly accommodating and saw we had had a rough time, she made sure we had clean towels, toiletries and some clothes we could borrow to sleep in. Janine also made sure to let us know the airport had contacted and our bags were being delivered. Great first stop after a terrible period of flying, a run of bad luck and jet lag! Thanks Janine!

->Deze plaats is een beetje verder van het centrum. Maar de buurt is zeker het bezoeken waard. De woning was heel rustig, het ligt op een gezellig pleintje vlakbij het water. De verhuurder deed er alles aan om ons verblijf zo vlot mogelijk te laten verlopen en geeft tevens heel wat tips. Er was tevens een zeer vlotte communicatie. 1 klein minpuntje was voor ons het bed. Een beetje aan de kleine kant en het piepte nogal. Daarnaast was alles in orde en zeker proper!

There's also plenty of storage space.  You would have shared use of the kitchen/dining area and the bathroom. <br /><br />The flat is at the end of Southwold Road, so no through traffic! It's right next Millfields Park and the canal. Clapton station is at the other end of the road, just under a 10 minute walk away.
REVIEWS:

->The bed was comfortable, the room and flat is spartan but clean. The neighbourhood might not suit everyone, especially if arriving late.  It was quite noisy until late at night. <br/>A reasonable budget room
->Nice location, and nice host…
->Great place!
->la estancia fue agradable. Las fotos muestran adecuadamente el estado de la casa y la habitación. La habitación esmuy austera y la camada es muy cómoda. el baño estaba limpio y ordenado. la zona es tranquila y agradable. Resulta un tanto lejana para hacer turismo aunque Hackney queda algo más cerca.
->We spent a whole month in Ian's flat. It was not a spacious one but we got everything we needed. Very cozy.  Ian and Shannon were responsive. <br/>There are bus stops and overground station nearby. Also, I felt quite safe even when I got back very late at night. It was a really wonderful experience.
->Exactly what I needed for the night. Good communication; and very easy check-in. Had a comfortable sleep and felt well rested. Fantastic value in the city.
->The place is simple but very spaceous and clean. Ian is quick to respond and accommodating to our requests. We have the entire place for ourselves most of the time. There are a few small groceries stores nearby as well. Though it takes about 8-10mins walk to the nearest Overground station (Overground train frequency is around 15mins ). Overall, it’s been a pleasant stay.
->We had a great stay, the room is big and has everything you need, the apartment is not perfect, but that's what we expected in London.
->We only met Ian briefly but he seemed like a nice host. We could use coffee, tea and the milk in the fridge and he left us some bread as well. The room is like in the pictures very basic but clean. However, the shower was a bit filthy and the kitchen floor looks like it has never been cleaned. The whole flat is extremely run-down which maybe does not matter to people if they just want a roof over their head but I think they should be aware of that when booking. If we would’ve known the state of the place we might’ve spent a bit more money on something else. It also would’ve been helpful to get a heads-up on how difficult the front door lock opens, we spent several minutes trying and low-key panicked that we might not get in at all. Also, we didn’t get wifi access until the next morning which was stressful since we couldn’t use our phone data and my friend needed to get in touch with someone back home urgently. In the future you could just leave a note in the room with the wifi password.
->We enjoyed our stay
