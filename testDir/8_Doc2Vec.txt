->We stayed at Aarav’s place for a weekend in June. The townhouse was a perfect fit for our large group of 8, and actually does have AC, even though we didn’t need it. <br/>The tube stop is very close, so it’s super easy to get anywhere you want in the city.  The location also borders Shoreditch, a very edgy and desirable  area of London that we love. If you’re unaccostumed to  city life, note that this location is lively at all hours, which was desirable for our group. <br/>There are several restaurants very closeby that we enjoyed - Grounded on White Chapel for breakfast was excellent as was for Sushinoen for sushi. <br/>Aarav was super responsive and we’d definitely return next time we are in London.
->Had a great stay !!
->The place is ideal for a family of 6. Neat and lots of space. Very bright.
->This spot is a great deal. Just be aware that the park is not the safest location. We weren’t really bothered but there’s clearly a lot of drug use/unsightly activity there. The police clear out the people but they come back each night. Overall this place and Aarav were a great deal and worth it. But I would keep in mind the park activity when deciding to book. <br/>All the food in the area is delicious and it’s right next to brick lane. <br/>Also pretty centrally located to city of London and the rest of London.
->The flat was perfectly equipped for what we needed for our stay, which was for work purposes. Extremely secure locking system to get inside the house which was reassuring with the park right outside and on the ground floor. The flat was clean and had everything we needed.
->Best Airbnb i’ve stayed at, super easy check in and entry/exit, and amazing homey apartment. Thanks!
->Overall stay was nice. As underground station 5 min walkable distance and have excellent connectivity through out London. But beside garden had not good crowd. It’s not seems that easy in night particularly with family. Also kitchen cutlery should increase as oven is there but bowls are not there similar like. But Aarav(host) response is very friendly. Also grocery store is 2 min walking distance.

->John's place was wonderful, closer than we expected it to be, to what we need. Extremely comfortable, and well decorated,  we would have stayed longer if the place was still available 
->This is the first time we've used airbnb and I can't see how it could of been a better experience, about 5 minutes after registering I was talking to John on the phone, with all the details done and dusted. I felt like I was chatting with a long lost brother! John met us at the flat which was absolutely as advertised if not better,it was warm and comfortable with an easy walk to DLR and Westfield shopping centre. The flat had everything you could need including secure private parking, there were lovely views across the canal and the Olympic park. There's lots of stylish glass walls in kitchen/siting room area, so the only thing I would bring next time is my dressing gown so that I don't frighten any canal walkers whilst making tea first thing in the morning.
->Great host. Great place. Highly recommendable. 
->John's place was perfect... We felt really comfortable; The beds were great. John was really helpful with giving advice for getting around London and even offered us a late check out. A great host. I would highly recommend his place. Thanks John.<br/>Rob
->We were 3 persons with disability,<br/>Nice view with clean flat and thanks John for the shower chair .<br/>Very far from the center we used to pay the cap 35-40£ in each way .<br/>One of the two bathrooms was under repairing for two days .. There was a problem in the heater we had cold showers  ..<br/>The cleaner(Sevetlana) came in to the flat with out a permition when we were out .. Then John send me a long message saying Sevetlana didn't found the bins while it was in the other room and there was a broken chair in the main room and I said it was already broken when we arrived .. I didn't like the way of checking . After a week from the check out John send me a bill to pay for a blocked sink that I don't know any thing about it . 
->We stayed at John's fabulous flat for my daughter's birthday with 4 of her friends. We had an amazing time - the flat is fantastic, really luxurious, spotlessly clean, lovely décor - the pictures do not do justice! John was a great host, really quick to respond and very helpful, even organising a taxi for us with a singing cabbie! Thanks for a great stay, we'll be back!  
->Fantastic place in an amazing location. Apartment was extremely clean with fabulous views across the Olympic park. John as very easy to deal with and always quick to respond.  Would definitely stay here again and recommend - thanks John it was perfect 
->John var väldigt trevlig och tillmötesgående. Har ansträngt sig för att ge en bra upplevelse och gav många bra tips och råd om området  och vad som fanns att se och göra. Lägenheten fungerade fint för våra behov. Väldigt ljus och fräsch med fin utsikt i ett intressant område. 
->Great apartment with beautiful views of the river and and across the Olympic park. Apartment was just as listed, clean and easily accessed from Stratford station. John was always quick to respond and easy to deal with, a great host. Would recommend this apartment.
->Beautiful luxurious apartment with two bathrooms and a nice view on the Olympic park in a cozy neighborhood. The subway is quite a distance walking.

->The place is clean and spacious for 8 to 10 peoples .Highly recommended very close by to many halal restaurants and shops.Transportation is very close by just about 10mins walk to White Chapel Station.Worth it
->The appartment was clean and in a great location, close to many public transport lines (bus, train, DLR, tube). There were towels & shower gel, 4 beds + 1 sofa bed, 1 large bathroom with bath and 1 small bathroom with toilet + shower. There was an issue with the lock when we arrived and we had to wait for 2.5 hours outside for the issue to be fixed. Overall, it is good value for the location and size.
->We are a group of 9 + 1. It’s  perfect.<br/>Comes with a cot if traveling with toddlers. For  large group that need to shop for halal groceries and cook.<br/>Comfortable and near the tube and bus to the attractions. Would recommend this house.
->El apartamento esta muy bien y es muy acogedor para  las 8 personas que éramos. La estancia allí ha sido genial. Un poco lejos del centro pero hay buena combinación de bus y metro.
->Este inmueble al parecer lo gestiona una agencia, de modo que no hay un anfitrión personalizada que se preocupe de manera personalizada por tu llegada y estancia, encontramos una persona que nos debía haber atendido a la llegada   (y no lo hizo ) y otra persona durante el día. No pudimos entrar al alojamiento porque la cerradura estaba rota y la persona que nos tenía que atender no nos cogió el teléfono. A las 2 de la mañana estábamos con 4 niños a la puerta del apartamento sin poder entrar.<br/>El estado del apartamento no era malo, pero necesita un mantenimiento urgente y que se repongan algunos de los utensilios, las sartenes no las pudimos ni gastar.<br/>la limpieza era regular sobretodo de las sabanas.<br/>Por comentar cosas positivas, la calefacción estupenda y la ubicación no está mal.
->Perfect location with supermarkets and restaurants near. Although the Underground stn requires 20 mins walk, there is a bus stop near the apartment which is convenient. Will stay again next time
->Lovely accommodation! It was an excellent space for us to get some work done as well as rest in peace! As I'm currently in the process of moving house, peace is hard to come by! <br/>Excellent hospitality, quick and clear responses and malleability to our times of arrival :)<br/>Will definitely be staying here again when I'm back in the area!
->Lovely apartment with easy access, great host with good communication. Definitely would recommend.
->Amazing place and is perfect for large groups, very handy for travelling to different parts of London as you have two underground stations and a overground in walking distance. Owners were extremely helpful, can’t think of a bad thing about the place.

REVIEWS:

->I came to london with 2 to of my girlfriends to celebrate my birthday weekend. This flat is located in a lovely hood with lots of restaurants, coffee shops, bars. The apartment was clean and cozy, except it did have cigarette smell that was hard for us to digest. We left windows wide open when we were out to get the fresh air but it still didn't help. I hope the owner will be able to take care of this for future bookings. The owner is really helpful and communicated very well with us. The bedding was clean. I stayed on the pull out sofa, which wasn't the most comfortable to sleep on but it was fine for 3 nights (probably wouldn't be able to sleep for longer than that). The bathrooms and the kitchen were clean and had all necessary accessories for us (shampoo, soup, etc). Overall - we had a great time and I would recommend this place.
->The Host of this property was fantastic, from jumping on a facetime with me when I first arrived, to responding to each of my messages in minutes. We had a situation that needed his attention, and in the middle of Eid, he stepped about to help me. The place was clean and the attention to detail was awesome. I'd mentioned I was brining my kids and an Easter Egg was hidden so the girls could have an egg hunt when we arrived. I do think there is a smoker downstairs, which is unfortunate as we had to open  the windows when we returned to the apartment but aside from that, it was great, plenty of space, even for four, well stocked kitchen to cook in, close to transit and a bunch of great food places within walking distance. It was practical as I needed to be close to the city, but accessible for London adventures.
->Great location and comfortable apartment
->The host is very responsive and accommodating
->Clean, large apartment is the centre of Aldgate. Stayed here whilst on a business trip and had everything I needed. Very close to Aldgate East (5 mins) and a short walk (12 mins) to Liverpool St station. Only small comment would be that the apartment got a little hot during a London heatwave. It was absolutely fine with the windows open during the day, but too noisy to sleep with them open given proximity to the main road. A small fan would have been a welcome addition! Thanks for a great stay though. Would definitely stay again!
->A comfortable, welcoming, bright home with amenities that work well. The location is quite good, we were able to hit favorite spots along Brick Lane. The London Museum isn't too far away. Victoria Park... Burough Market.. The building has a lobby with an attendant on duty. The host makes you feel welcome from the start. and check in was easy.
->Good and nice apartment
->The apartment had a nice layout with two bedrooms and two bathrooms with a spacious lining area. The location isn’t in the nicest part of town.
->Very disappointed overall. Very old building and not so clean apartment, so much for 440£ per night.
->Nice and clean apartment quite close to Tower and Sky Garden. Hence, perfect for our stay. Thank you!

->The best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! Everything was lovely and very reasonably priced! Would recommend to anyone who wants to stay around the area! Very accommodating to our needs!
->The space was great and as advertised! You have a great view of the London skyline.  The location is close to public transport (approximately 12 minute walk to the tube).  There is a lively night scene and grocer within easy walking distance on Leman Street.  It is very clean with all the essentials provided by the host.  Harriet was in constant contact with us to ensure our stay was trouble free.  We would definitely stay again on a visit to London!!
->Very good
->We were 5 adults and a baby so this was a perfect space for us. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with the wonderful view, the space, nice kitchen, nice sheets and towels, it was perfect! :) highly recommended! :)
->great location, spacious place, highly recommend it
->Lovely place to stay.  Clean, quiet and secure.  Fantastic view of the city and dock lands in the evenings.  A Short walk to the Tube or DLR station puts docklands or the city a short ride away.  Can’t really fault it.  Thanks!
->The lift is unstable. We were blocked in the lift for about 5 minutes and no door guards  nor  CCTV come to help!  It was a horrible experience.
->This apartment has a great location for sightseeing in London. It is close to three tube stations, Tower Hill, Shadwell, and Aldgate.  There are plenty of restaurants and stores with a variety of food options and price range. It has a nice view of the skyline and is located on the top floor (12).  It has plenty a room and is a 2 story apartment.  It was our first AirBnB stay and it worked well for us because we are a family of 4, two adults and 2 teenagers that need there own beds, which is better then getting two hotel rooms for the week. The host communicate quickly by email, and answer all of our questions. We rented a car our last day to visit Stonehenge and was able to park at the apartment overnight, because we got back late.  We had to arrange that ahead of time with the Concierge/doorman but it was easy. 
->Harriet’s place was totally gorgeous, it was great for our three night stay. Host was communicative and easy to reach. Ample space for our family of five. We enjoyed being on the balcony every evening with great views of the City! Very walkable to Tower of London and Tower Bridge. Eat a Cirilo’s - it was amazing food close by! <br/>As a side note: we were in London during some of their hottest days in years as they were experiencing a heatwave. The place has no AC which we knew prior to booking, but it was quite hot in London. This is no fault of the host just a fluke heatwave in Europe - and us being silly Americans used to AC! But worth noting in case you book in summer to be prepared. There are fans in the house and that was helpful during the heatwave! <br/>Overall a great place to stay!
->My family  had  a lovely one week stay at Harriet’s place. The check in experience was excellent and a pack of strawberries was provided as a welcome amenity!  Nice touch from a responsive host.The penthouse apartment is spacious, very clean with essential amenities and amazing views of the city. <br/>There is no A/C in the apartment which we knew about before booking, but Harriet provided fans and a portable cooling unit to make my family comfortable. It was about 10 minutes walk to the nearest train station and easy to order an Uber to the apartment complex. Overall, a great comfortable  stay. We will book again on another trip.

->This apartment is really lovely. It was spotlessly clean and has beautiful views across London. Both bedrooms and the living room had a fan in which came in really handy in the heat! I was surprised and pleased to find lots of things in the cupboards that you might need - coffee, cooking ingredients, washing powder etc.
->Martin was a wonderful host and the apartment was great! Lovely view, sensible floor plan, cute terrace, well furnished, etc. Martin was also really kind in helping us check in early and accommodating the fact that we had a baby (he had the crib set up, for example)! Thanks Martin!
->The apartment is exactly as shown on the pictures. The location is really good with just a couple of minutes walk to the next underground station or the Tower of London.

->Apartment was better than the pics, friendly host to arrange, clean, comfortable and well located. Five star. 
->We really really enjoyed staying in this apartment, the apartment is really nicely designed you can see Neil is very proud of it, it's quite spacious with two bathrooms and in a very nice and quiet area. Getting around London was quite convenient with two tube stations with 5 mins walking distance.<br/><br/>It was a last minute booking and Neil and his team did everything to make it happen smoothly and they gave us great local area recommendation<br/><br/>We are definitely staying here next time we come to London.
->Neil's apartment was absolutely brilliant - excellent location, very spacious and modern, with everything you could possibly need. Neil was very helpful throughout the whole process and provided lots of great recommendations in the area. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for somewhere to stay in East London. 
->appartement correspondant à l'annonce, super réception avec Sally.<br/>super déco vintage. je reviendrais dans cet appartement <br/>merci neil et sally
->Really enjoyed our stay at Neil's place. Was just as nice in reality as the pictures. Even with 6 of us staying there was plenty of room.<br/>Great location only a few minutes walk to the tube station and you pass a Tesco on way back to buy any necessary snacks and bevvies!! <br/>Thanks!
->We enjoyed very much this comfortable apartment, nicely furnished, conveniently located not far from 3 metro stations. <br/>Niel, his mother and Sally were very helpful in the preparation and while on-site.<br/>A place to recommend for a family with teenagers. <br/>Thanks<br/><br/>
->The apartment was beautiful and very well equipped. It was very easy to find and it was very quiet. There is a tesco 2 minutes walk away but the apartment did have tea, coffee, sugar, condiments etc which was useful. <br/>We walked along Regents Canal to Broadway Market through Victoria Park and we would highly recommend this as an option. It is not touristy in the way of places such as Covent Garden and there were lots of lovely cafes and bars as well as the stalls selling various foods. We walked from their through London Fields to Hackney Central and the Overground to Stratford. <br/>The apartment is very well located for travelling around London. I would stay here again if I visited London. Sally met us at the apartment with keys etc. and she was lovely and helpful.<br/>I communicated with Neils mum when making equiries about the apartment and she was very helpful and answered any questions prompltly.<br/>All in all a very comfortable place to stay with good access to the underground system.
->A great, tidy apartment. The beds were super comfortable, the kitchen well-equipped, the wifi fast and a large TV. Neil's neighbour Sally who let us in to the apartment was also very friendly and helpful. This is the second of Neil's properties my friends and I have stayed in and we've been very impressed with both.
->地方就如想像一樣舒適簡潔，五人入住完全沒有壓迫感，每天煮食就如在家一樣，位置跟tube , supermarket 只需兩至三分鐘路程，去zone 1較city地區都是十分鐘左右，方便得很。有空一定要試試在tube出口租單車，到10分鐘左右車程的一個公園，沿河邊走，會遇上有趣的河上cafe呢 ! Neil跟Sally是十分友善的host , 我們遇上麻煩立刻幫忙真的十分感激，我地在倫敦玩得很開心：)<br/>Neil place same as we imagine , comfortable , fashion , we have 5 people still very free , and we cook everyday as a home :D<br/>Location just 2-3mins near tube and supermarket , to zone 1 about 10mins only , but i suggest rent a bicycle in front of tube and ride around 10mins , you will see a park and ride along the river , there have some interesting cafe must go :)<br/>Neil and Sally are wonderful host , when we have some trouble they help us a lot , really thanks and we have a great time in our first time in UK :D <br/>(Oh , we forget to ask your lovely dog name , she so sweet  ❣)
->Accoglienza perfetta, famiglia disponibilissima per qualsiasi cosa. C'è stato un piccolo problema con l'acqua calda ma è stato fatto di tutto per rimediare prontamente e in cambio abbiamo ricevuto una bottiglia di vino e una scatola di cioccolatini. L'appartamento è nuovo, pulitissimo e dotato di tutti i confort, stoviglie, asciugamani, coperte, ecc. Non abbiamo avuto bisogno di comprare niente. L'appartamento è in un'ottima posizione, in 5 minuti si raggiunge la stazione della metro e del bus e quindi in poco tempo si raggiunge il centro città.<br/>Assolutamente consigliabile.

->Awesome Apartment in an amazing location. Will be checking it's availability everytime I need a place to stay in London.
->Perfect communication. Well located. Great space!!
->A very nice Flat
->The location of this apartment is great for a stay in London and there is lots of bars etc very close by. The apartment is spacious and was ideal for a group of 8 for one night. We weren't pleased with there being a strong smell of sick in one of the bedrooms and some mould in the other bedroom and a few other things. However, I wouldn't not recommend staying here as they are things that could easily be sorted.
->The place is located in one of the many beautiful and artsy places in london. It is pretty close to everything if you uber, and has public transportation near by. When comes to the place, when we stayed one of the rooms was smelly and the problem was never solved. Then the showers were very inconsistent one day they worked the other they did not.
->A great, modern and clean apartment in a great location for exploring Shoreditch and the surrounding areas. Check-in was simple, communication between myself and the host was efficient and quick. Would definitely recommend and would stay again.
->A great place to stay in a great area, I would highly recommend. 
->Booked this for a pre-wedding get together for a group of friends: the location of the flat was amazing and perfect for a one night stay to access nearby nightlife and fun stuff nearby on each of the days. Living room sleeping was pretty noisy for those on the sofa beds but, to be fair, the listing did mention that! The separate bedrooms were great though and really nice shower/bathroom facilities. We didn't use the kitchen on this stay but there were decent looking facilities and a large table.
->The apartment is beautiful, very nice, clean and with views from the neighbourhood. I went with a group of students and they really loved the place and the location of the apartment. Really good! The check in and check out were easy and very simple. 
->Perfect for an affordable place to sleep at night, the beds were comfy. Hot tap in the en suite shower was broken which was a nuesance as there were 8 of us that wanted showers every night but the shower in the main bathroom that worked was lovely! <br/>There was already an array of essentials in the kitchen, coffee tea sugar jam salt spices etc. <br/>The washing machine door was broken so we couldn't use it but there is a dishwasher which saved us doing the washing up!!<br/>All in all, it was a pleasant stay :-)

->It was perfect place for us.
->Lovely place, went on to extend our stay and couldn't have asked for a better time! Thank you, John Paul
->John Paul's place made us feel very well at home and its closeness to amenities is a real seller! Had a lovely time, thanks once again!
->I stayed in John Paul's place with some colleagues to attend a conference nearby. It was wonderful-clean, with stunning views of the city, and interacting with John Paul was simple. <br/>Would happily return!
->This appartment is a great stay, close to the tube, fantastic view, lots of space. We really enjoyed our weekend at it. John Paul reacts quik and help you with questions, lots of london tips in the appartment.
->This was a great location for an event we were attending in Victoria Park. Amazing views across London. Super easy access to tube and Sainsbury's. We felt very safe and comfortable. An excellent spot for our family. The only thing to note is that there is no air conditioning.
->John Paul's apartment is perfectly located and absolutely spotless.  Large, spacious and bright with lots of windows and amazing views of London.  The kitchen is well equipped with everything we needed.  Very comfortable and modern, and wonderful to have free parking and Sainsbury's right underneath!  The apartment is very quiet - we didn't hear a sound from neighbours etc. Loved it! 
->Stylish apartment in a high rising complex near the Bromley Line. Good value for money and has all essentials. Make sure you're not afraid of heights because it is high up!
->Amazing place, good location.  Loved the view.
->This apartment is well positioned near Stratford in Eastern London. <br/>Very near the Bromley-by-Bow  tube station. It has a moderate sized Tesco super market within 5 minutes walk and a small Sainsbury local at the bottom of the apartment block. It has great views over London, however it is close  to a major highway which meant in a very hot summer it was super noisy 24/7.  The table and chairs were really unstable. We had to make our beds up on arrival with linen that didn’t fit. While the apartment was superficially clean we had to spend some significant time cleaning the  oven, floors, vacuum cleaner and buying and replacing light bulbs in bedside lamps. Some what poor attention to detail.

REVIEWS:

->The accommodation check in process was easy, and the location was great (10/10). Unfortunately the accommodation itself was not that good. The entrance to the accommodation looks you’re entering the slums of Mumbai. Once inside, the living room was of a nice standard but wasn’t clean, with stains and dust everywhere. The TV also wasn’t working. Only one shower out of the two was working, and both showers were actually dirty and were blocked. The one shower that worked would cut the hot water off after 2 minutes use (I suspect because the owner wants to limit how much hot water we use!) The biggest issue we had was two people in the party didn’t have any duvets for sleeping because we couldn’t find the linens for the sofa beds, and so had to use the towels as blankets! (Turns out the owner keeps the linens hidden somewhere in the sofa and claims he explains where these are in an ‘apartment guide’ that we weren’t told about and I don’t think exists!). <br/>Overall, for the amount we spent the accommodation was ok, but be prepared for most things not to work or for things to be dirty.
->The Host Was, Amazing
->Clean and well furnished apartment <br/>Good communication from host
->Blinds broken in bedroom letting light in. Tv doesn’t work due to bad signal. Shower in en suite cold. Toilet seat in en suite broken. Good communication and check in details from host
->shops, food, drinks local
->Great location and value for money, some small issues with one shower not turning on but apart from that great! Would stay again :)
->Host has disappointing behaviour and poor response time
->We enjoyed our stay, lovely little apartment with a spacious living room. Great location and good value for money. Parking very close which was reasonably priced too.
->nice clean spacious apartment right in the middle of Shoreditch.  Good find, thanks!
->This apartment was just what we needed (essentially a crash pad for four of us after a night out in Shoreditch) - great location, plenty big enough for us, comfy beds and two bathrooms. Check-in procedure and communication was very good.
