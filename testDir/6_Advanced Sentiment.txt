  name: Romantic & Cool London Get away. Close to centre
  description: Lovely big home in Streatham with a large garden. Perfect for a romantic get away. <br />Now only taking two guests as my teenagers bedrooms are no longer to be rented out and used. <br />Modern kitchen and bathroom with shower and bath. We are near the train line and Central London (i.e. London Bridge & Victoria ) is a mere 25 minutes away. Balham for direct tube connections into London is 7 mins by train. It doesn’t get much easier. <br />Lots of restaurants, bars and supermarkets nearby.<br />Perfect base.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />This is a large house with lots of space. We live here, it is very much our home and you will see that around you. Not a 'buy to let' that’s empty and without character. Best bonus is this: everything is provided for you and you can use what's here. (Shampoo, herbs & oils, loo roll, coffee etc)<br />There is tv, Netflix, and a Sonos music system. <br /><br />On some occasions I can shop and leave basics for a first dinner or breakfast.

->Das Haus ist sehr stilvoll eingerichtet. Wir haben uns sofort sehr wohl gefühlt. Es fehlte an nichts. Laura war sehr aufmerksam während unseres Aufenthaltes, obwohl sie abwesend war. Es war alles sehr ordentlich und sauber. Unsere Kinder haben sich mit Lauras Katze sofort angefreundet. Wir kommen sehr gerne wieder.
->Laura was a very lovely host. We loved here buitiful house and especially our son also loved here very nice and friendly cat. We can more than recommend Laura as a host. Claus and family
->Laura ist eine sehr hilfsbereite, grosszügige Gastgeberin. Sie war stets bemüht für unser Wohl. In ihrem wunderschön eingerichteten Haus, fühlten wir uns sofort zu hause. Unsere Tochter liebte Lauras Katze und fütterte sie gerne.<br/>Der Weg in die Stadt ( Victoria Station ) war einfach mit der Bahn in 25min erreichbar.<br/>Wir hatten eine gute Zeit in London.<br/>Vielen Dank und beste Grüsse aus der Schweiz!
->Laura has a very beautiful and lovely home with everything you need. Also the cat is adorable and the garden is a plus. We felt completely contented. Very recommendable place and Laura is also a very kind guest.
->Communication avec Laura très fluide et de nombreux conseils avisés comme par exemple celui de visiter le marché de Brixton. Les instructions concernant l'arrivée et le départ étaient claires et précises.

->Laura has a lovely place in a great part of town. It's near some beautiful green spaces and plenty of things to do nearby. Sparkling clean and great hospitality too!
->This place is stunning. The photos do not so it justice. Spacious and airy with beautiful furnishings. The kitchen is my kinda space! A bonus having the outdoor space too, it was really hot so the seating area was a welcome addition. Laura was so thoughtful she even went out of her way to buy us feather free bedding. Bed was super comfortable and the shower was just what was needed after long summer days in London.<br/>Loved it!<br/>
->Een heerlijk thuis in Londen! Zeer de moeite waard.

->The absolute highlight of my AirBnB experience.<br/>The best choice for first-time visitors to London ( and of course if you are familiar with London there is no need to explain how convenient the place and how fair the price is ) Jiawei is a multilingual super host with an enthralling life story. This will undoubtedly be my top choice in the future  下次一定还来 ～～<br/>Overall <br/>- incredibly secure place,<br/> - close to everything in the city, 3 minutes' walking distance to metro <br/>- my favourite sainsbury nearby <br/>- a wonderful spot for outdoor exercise as well <br/>- most importantly, good design and vast inside space
->Great location, easy check in, prompt replies from the host.
->Joel are very kind and chatty, the house is clean and the space is large, the location is also very good, I feel very comfortable living here, I will want to stay here again next time, I think the price is very good than staying in a hotel!!!!!!
->The host is very responsive and supportive，the location is great！<br/>Two things to keep in mind：1） There is no showing facility （only bathtub，and it's in the bedroom on the carpet）2. The temperature of the hot water from the tub i<br/>was not consistent，sometimes it became cold and last for a while （after only 11 minutes ）<br/>Overall happy with the location and service.
->Y sitio tranquilo cómodo y muy bonito, el mejor lugar para hospedarse en Londres
->Great stay
->We’ve had an amazing 3 day stay and the room sounded almost too good (cheap) to be true. However everything was exactly like in the description and the hosts have been very responsive! Would totally stay here again!
->위치가 좋았습니다.
->Good
->We really enjoyed our stay here. The location was great - able to travel to different places easily. The place was clean, homely and had everything we could possibly have needed. <br/>We would have been more comfortable with the stay if we had some cover for the bathtub to provide more privacy. <br/>On the whole, we really enjoyed our stay here and were grateful to our hosts!!<br/>Thank you!

->It was a perfect week end. The accomadation is beautiful. Simone and her husband are so nice.
->It look way better than it does in the pictures. I loved it, Simone was welcoming she gave us Oyster cards. Maps it for London. 
->What an excellent experience!<br/>Simone and Nicolas waited up for us to arrive after our flight came in very late! (We really appreciated that).<br/>They are super kind and genuine people. When we arrived they gave us a tour and showed us  how to work everything, they also left us bus maps and Oyster cards (VERY big help).<br/>The apartment was perfect for us. We were shocked at how big it was, the pictures don’t do it justice!<br/>Was very pleased to see there was iron board!<br/>The only thing I would suggest would be to have a garbage in the bathroom ( for us females). <br/>But other than that.. we had an amazing stay at Simone and Nicholas’s place. HIGHLY recommend booking your stay there. You won’t be disappointed. <br/>Thanks Simone and Nicholas!!
->Simone and Nicholas were exceptional hosts, welcoming and friendly.  <br/>Simone who speaks only a few words in french really tried to make the communication easier which my friend really appreciated at the check in time. Therefore, they made sure that they were speaking slowly and they were articulate that he could understand. <br/>They are both fantastic, very helpful, mindful and available. Moreover, they prepared a welcome pack with maps, oyster card and other information as such as the shops around with timetable and also the main buses to get back to their place. That was adorable and useful by the way. <br/>Futhermore, the flat was perfect... sparkly, modern and cosy. We immediately felt like home.<br/>PS : They are getting ready for a hudge special event shortly 😉.<br/>Do not hesitate, carry on and book in!  
->Simone’s place is such a great little apartment, it’s very modern and stylish especially the balcony and bathroom. Me and my boyfriend only stayed for one night but we wish we’d stayed longer! It was much better than a lot of 3/4* hotels we’ve stayed in previously. Simone showed us around upon our arrival and left us a fridge full of food and drinks to help ourselves to, as well as plenty of info about the surrounding area and travel info etc. The area was quaint with public transport points very close by and also with a lovely convenience store just minutes away. Would definitely recommend as I have nothing to fault!!
->Simone’s place was great. It was really clean and homely, and had great transport links into the centre of London. Simone was really hospitable, and gave us Oyster cards to use during our stay. I would definitely recommend!
->Simone and Nic's apartment is really beautiful, spotlessly clean, and had everything we needed for our overnight stay. Fantastic views and sunbathing from the balcony, toiletries galore, Oyster cards, fully equipped kitchen and even food in the fridge, Simone went above and beyond to ensure our stay was as comfortable and easy as possible! Slightly slow/temperamental internet was the only thing keeping this apartment from perfection, it really is bigger and better than the pics, a truly super find, and we look forward to staying here again! 
->My girlfriend and I stayed here for our weekend away in London. We really enjoyed our stay and would 100% recommend this place. The apartment was so clean and really well decorated.<br/>There was also parking available in the building. The hosts were so friendly and provided information about local shops/transport in the local area. They also provided Oyster cards which was very handy! They were both lovely and really helped us settle in and sorted any issues we had!<br/>The area was also very well connected with buses and the underground. It took her about 20-30 minutes to get to the centre of London. <br/>Just wish we had longer to enjoy this lovely air b&b!
->The apartment is large, spacious and brilliantly equipped. We love the light airy space and it was a great base for our weekend away. Simone and Nicholas are lovely hosts.
->Simone and Nicholas were great hosts! Great commutation and always at hand if we needed to ask any questions! The flat was everything we could of asked for (and more) very clean, homely and stylish a lot bigger than photos as well. Location was great with a big Sainsbury’s only 6 minutes walk away. Good bus and train links into Central London and Simone and Nicholas even provided Oyster cards! If we could give them a 6 star rating we would. Would happily stay there again.

->Excellent flat very close to hyde park. The place is good for couples - nice and a little bit small bedroom with TV, fully equipped kitchen, and bathroom. The shower is really low so has to pat attention. good heat, no noise in bedroom. 10 min walking from circle and central line so really good access to the center. there is tesco nearby and some nice pubs  in area. you also can go to portobello market - 15 min walking. Jihanne made it easy to check in and always available to help. Really good value for money.

->Very nice room and good facilities. Good quality of tissue paper.
->Very cosy flat and very well situation to discover all you want ! I will come back <br/>Jihanne is very reactive to have us a good stay !
->Stay from this inhuman and heartless host! I dont understand why this home is still in the listing. She cancelled the reservation and made me to move out in the middle of the stay without giving me any time to find another apartment. I had the worst time in London because of this Airbnb host but Airbnb is doing nothing to amend this. In order to prevent the same situation from happening, this home must be taken out immediateiy from Airbnb.

REVIEWS:

->The apartment is wonderful.
->La Petite Mademoiselle offered a fantastic location and perfectly appointed accommodations on my  most recent trip to London.  Everything about my stay was delightful and the host was attentive and responsive to any of my requests or questions.  The flat was very clean, incredibly charming, in an incredibly safe location and is well designed to allow for a maximum use of space.  I look forward to returning!
->We had a fantastic time at the apartment, loved the decor and the location is unbeatable.  We spent time in the West End and it was easy to get to from Kensington High Street, either a cab, Uber or tube.  The pub across the road is excellent as is the deli a few doors down the road.  Highly recommended.
->Megan was very attentive to our needs. The apartment was a bit flamboyant for our taste but if you’re into that, this place is perfect. Location is very nice with a café and restaurant right outside our door. 5-10 minute stroll between High Street Kensington and Earl’s Court underground stations. One block from a nice Waitrose Partners grocery store. There is a narrow spiral staircase leading up to the large bathroom. A half-bath (toilet and sink only) on the main level.
->Fantastic stay! Beautifully decorated and a great place to relax in the busy city of London! Megan was ready to help us in any way :)
->We loved this place! From check-in to check-out it was flawless. You will have trouble finding a better location in Kensington as this flat is right off the High St. (directly next door to a cafe/deli and across the street from an amazing restaurant). I highly recommend both places to eat! The flat is beautifully decorated and it felt like home for 8 days- super quiet and peaceful. Megan and Michael were very nice to work with- just can’t say enough good things about this place! <br/>10/10 xx
->Great stay, lovely flat and location. Highly recommend.
->My second time staying here.  I love it for it’s comfort and awesome location.  I was here for work and getting around London is a breeze from here.  In the city in 22 minutes was my best time on the tube and really effortless.  The pub across the road is 35 feet away, the healthy cafe is even closer and yet it’s still quiet.  Becoming my go to place when in London.
->Perfect all around, will be coming back for sure !
->Beautiful neighborhood and very thoughtfully decorated flat. Megan was very responsive when we had questions and check in was seamless. Thank you!

->Michael was a great host, before we arrived he was always promt to answer any questions we had and also was helpful with direstions. Michael was accomodating even though we were late arriving. He  made us feel at home from the moment we walked in. We were even offered beers from the fridge! The apartment is in a nice location and the building itself is very secure. Close to the tube station which was ideal. We will stay here again hopefully!
->The pictures do not reflect the reality as the apartment is classy, super clean, spacious and include everything you might need during your stay. The building is new and secure. The location is just PERFECT only 2 minutes away from Holloway Road Tube Station. The host is friendly, helpful and always available. In short, I truly felt that I am at my own home!
->This was our first experience with Airbnb and it was amazing! Michael was kind to show us around on arrival and was easily accessible by email. <br/>It's the best neighbourhood if you are there to see a football game at Emirates stadium. The patio literally looks over the stadium and it is very exciting if you have an Arsenal fan with you. There is lots of little food shops nearby and the tube station is less than 5 min walk. The flat was perfect. Very clean and modern with an excellent use of space. The washers/dryer in the flat was a real bonus and Michael was wonderful to let us know how to use it. The bed was incredibly comfortable and I had the best nights sleep in a long time. My favourite moment was sitting in the living room with a cup of tea in the early morning and enjoying the peace and quiet.                                                          Michael's flat feels like home and his welcoming presence is so settling. I would recommend everyone to stay here! Thank you so much, Michael!<br/>
->Michael is great! Super pleasant and helpful, fast to respond and very nice in general. He was hosting my brother who came to visit and has a really nice place and in general was a great experience. Definitely recommend!
->Michael was very friendly and extremely easy to deal with. As far as the flat goes, the pictures really don't do it justice, it was great! 
->As someone already mentioned the pictures don't do justice to the actual place. It's a nice flat only a stone throw away from the tube station with a fantastic bed. Michael was prompt, easy to communicate with and an overall chilled out host.
->I have to agree with the other comments, which state that the pictures don't do justice to this place - they really don't! <br/><br/>It's a REALLY modern and REALLY spacious one bedroom flat with a huge bed and a cosy sofa. Both living room and bedroom (and balcony) offer a great view to Emirates Stadium. My sister and dad stayed here while they visited me in London and they absolutely loved Michael's place, especially compared to the other option, which would have been a hotel room. This way they had a lot more space around them and they were able to feel more 'free' and comfortable during their stay. <br/><br/>Holloway Road station is only 5 minutes away (as well as the closest grocery story) and takes you to central London in 15 minutes or so, directly to Heathrow in 1 hour. Very convenient location!<br/><br/>Michael was a wonderful host. I couldn't recommend his place enough! 
->Great welcome from Michael. Easy to contact, helpful and accommodating. Beautiful new apartment. Bright, light, spotless. Amazingly comfortable bed. Dream come true for Arsenal fans - right next to Emirates.  Fantastic location 3 mins from Holloway Road station. Will definitely rebook. 
->Michael was a fantastic host and apartment is modern bright and clean. Really good location and perfect for a stay in London. Would go back again! 
->I stayed at Michael's place for two weeks while I was in London for work. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay! The apartment was beautiful and had everything I needed including a washing machine. It is in a secure apartment building, so very safe. The location was great. The tube station and supermarket were both within 5 minutes walking distance. I would definitely like to stay again. Thank you Michael!

->Die Wohnung vermittelt ein Gefühl von zuhause. In einem guten Wohnumfeld ist die Lage absolut ruhig (wie bei uns zuhause auf dem Dorf) und trotzdem ist die undergroundstation Swiss Cottage innerhalb rund 10 Minuten zu Fuß gut zu erreichen. In der Zone 2 gelegen hatten wir so die Möglichkeiten auch bis kurz vor der letzten UBahn London zu genießen. Durch das Schlafzimmer und das Wohnzimmer kann man sich (reist man zu zweit) auch zwischenzeitlich aus dem Weg gehen. Die Kommunikation mit Viktoria ist phantastisch. Wir fühlten uns die ganze Zeit gut und familiär aufgehoben und würden hier auf jeden Fall wieder buchen.
->Victoria’s flat was just perfect for our recent trip to London. <br/>Flat is located close to the Jubilee tube line which makes it super convenient to get anywhere in and around London. <br/>There are many options for shopping within a 10 minute walk from The flat … so you are spoiled for choice <br/>Flat is located in a picturesque news and you will find that the flat is well equipped and has everything you would need … not to mention a fantastic shower (which is a rarity in London). <br/>Would definitely look to stay at Victoria’s flat again on future trips to London 😊
->Very nice flat in the best area of London (belsize village). The flat was big, well furnished, close to belsize Park and all the shops. Victoria was very nice and ready to help, much appreciated! We had a great stay.

->We highly recommend a stay in Peter's apartment in Chelsea Harbour, London.  It is a lovely apartment that is spacious and airy and surrounded by many windows throughout which provide plenty of natural light.  The kitchen is well-equipped and the bed is extremely comfortable.  The balconies on either side of the living room are exceptional features.  We always felt safe in the apartment which is located within a gated complex and so appreciated its close proximity to Imperial Wharf station, the bus stop, and the neighborhood Tesco grocery store.  Taxi and other transportation services were very easy to summon and our wait was never longer than a few minutes.  Our host, Peter, is very friendly and ensured that we had all that we needed for a comfortable and enjoyable stay.  We were so grateful for his hospitality, that he greeted us upon our arrival, and that he was readily available throughout our stay. <br/>We absolutely loved our stay in Peter's apartment and will be glad to stay again in the future whenever we return to London.  It was a wonderful home away from home!
->excellent location, super clean, comfortable, highly recommended
->Peter was a great host! Really easy to contact and accommodated our check-in needs. The flat itself is in pristine condition and well-kept, it was a lovely place to stay. We would love to stay again in the future!
->Peter’s place was fabulous! We were personally greeted upon check-in and check out. The flat was immaculately clean and extremely comfortable. It is located in a safe area, you can easily walk to places of interest and restaurants, and it is close to bus stops and an Overground station. We will definitely book to stay here again.

->We stayed 5 days, and syed was a perfect host. Incredibly responsive and friendly.<br/>A very short walk from the tube, and close to a grocery store.<br/>The studio had all the essentials, and plenty of room. 10/10 Would stay again
->Lovely host, close to all underground stations and easy to get to places:) <br/>Will 100% be returning
->Nice and clean house. Enjoyed the outdoor area :) During the summer it can get warm but Syed was really nice to provide us with a fan. The train tracks are close by so you can hear them going pass.
->Lovely little apartment, would recommend!
->Very good house with a lovely private garden! Welcome host. Close to underground, so it's convenient to travel, but a little bit noisy.
->Very clear instructions for checking in. Syed replies to messages quick. Great location for the place, close to two underground stations, a lot of restaurants and supermarket. Can easily go to city in a short time.<br/>Thank you Syed!
->We were satisfied with our stay in this  studio. It has the advantage of having a small garden in which we relaxed and it  is in a convenient location for the bus lines and the underground. Order, cleanliness and communication with Syed pleasantly completed our stay.
->It was a really great stay I enjoyed it very much!
->The mini apartment is very nice, even if very small...but it is equipped with all necessary stuff. Unfortunately the train rails are really close so when the trains pass, the noise could awake you during the early morning. The hos is very kind and helpful!
->Brilliant stay! 10/10<br/>Syed is a great host! He made it clear from the start that we could contact him about any issues we had, and he would reply to messages almost instantly and help in any way he could!<br/>Checking in was a breeze as Syed supplied very detailed instructions with a step-by-step guide with what we had to do. He provided great information throughout our stay and answered all of our questions!<br/>The flat is very well situated from Dollis Hill station, a short walk and a few stops down the Jubilee Line and you’re in Central London. It’s a great place to stay if you want to experience the city but also want a quiet place to relax in the evenings in a respectable neighbourhood.<br/>Would definitely recommend this place for a short city break, we loved it!<br/>Thanks Syed :)

->My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Jenny's flat. It's on a beautiful street in a beautiful neighborhood that gives you a taste of living in London. Very convenient to shopping, food, and a quick tube ride away from more touristy areas and sights. The apartment itself was very comfortable and just as advertised. Jenny was very welcoming when we arrived and easy to communicate with during our trip. Thanks Jenny!
->Amazing location, a bit noisy but at least it's​ a good way to get out of bed without an alarm clock!
->Location cannot be beat, 2 Mins walk from Sloane Square tube station and walking distance from major commercial and grocery stores.  Studio is small but with great amenities and furnishings. The studio is located below street level making it a bit noisy and with light coming in through the blinds during early morning hours. <br/>Jennifer, the host, is amazing and was very accommodating and easy to communicate with. If you’re looking for a centrally located studio, this is a very nice option. 
->Jenny's cozy, modern, beautiful condo is perfectly located in the middle of Sloane Square, one of the best areas in London for shopping, cafe-going, walking to beautiful sights, etc. The amenities were fabulous, the connection with Jenny was effortless, warm and fast, and we would stay there again in a heartbeat. Thanks so much!
->Excellent place, just as advertised, Great location for getting around, Jenny was a great host, it was all very easy for us.  Would stay there again.  
->I will start by saying the hosts could not have been nicer or more accommodating.  However, the trip was a disaster.   The kitchen lights/appliances (coffee maker / dishwasher) did not work at any point.  The washing machine broke at one point.  The alarm went off in the building on two separate occasions for hours at a time.  They did construction outside the home every morning at 6am.  The floors would flood every morning when the air conditioning was left too long and wet all our clothes.   Essentially - nothing worked and the owner was unwilling to compensate me or refund any part of my stay.  I was very disappointed with how it was handled - given the pure quantity of inconveniences that happened during the stay. 
->Jenny is simply the best host. I had booked this studio but one day prior to my arrival she called me and said there was a problem with air conditioning and water all over the floor. Before I panic, she offered me another studio very close to the previous one. I was greeted by Alan, a very nice friend of Jenny’s. He helped me with the bags and even bought some bread, prosciutto and a Spanish sparkling wine. Lovely! The studio is on the second floor of a brick building at Cadogan Gardens. Very well appointed with everything I needed. The only negative thing is the shower- even though it’s huge - almost no water comes through it, with no pressure at all. And I value a good shower! <br/>But overall I thank Jenny so much for caring about me and for relocating me to a very good studio. Thanks, Jenny! See you next time!!!!
->Great place. Good location. Great hospitality. Jennifer even let us check in very early.  Thanks again.
->Jennifer and team were amazing.  My best Airbnb stay to date.  All the little touches to make my stay perfect. The location is amazing so close to Sloan’s square and the Kong’s road everything is at your finger tips. And the flat was better than the photos show.  I highly recommend this flat and this host!  Thank you!!  I do hope to get a chance to stay in your lovely flat again!
->Prime location, very quite even though it’s right off king st and a stones throw from all hot spots. The space is comfortable for one person, and was clean on my arrival. Recommend Jennifer and her charming studio

->Great looking and house
->Housing fully met our expectations. The apartment is bright, clean, with a beautiful design and large windows. There is a temperature controller, so it was warm and comfortable. Also, the apartment is tranquil, since the street is not loaded with cars, and the second windows overlook the inner courtyard. Everything is for convenience: stove, toaster, microwave, kettle, hairdryer, iron, washing machine. The metro is 10 minutes away, but we often travelled by double-decker buses, as there is a bus stop next to the house. Once again I want to thank Paige for such beautiful apartments. I can happily recommend them!
->Great space in a trendy neighborhood! Quite cozy but has everything you need! 10 min walk to Brixton tube was easy and takes you through the markets! I would recommend!
->Excellent location, very comfortable flat, I was there in the winter and the flat was really warm. Very clean and had everything I needed. Lovely to walk to Tulse Hill to the Market on Sunday. Brixton tube is a short walk, and the Victoria line underground is excellent. Buses are easy to catch also. Totally can recommend this place.
->Overall stay was absolutely fine - good location, all the basics, easy checkin with the subcontracted Hosting team. However the flat did not match the photos - same style but different layout (felt a lot smaller than we expected). Very minimalist (and strangely all the cardboard boxes from the appliances all over the place?) and could have done with a few more useful or homely details (salt/pepper, grater, the warm-looking lamp and flower arrangements from the photos). The subcontracted hosting team also scheduled our checkout for 10am when the listing clearly said 11am, which was stressful.
->A wonderful spot in a great location. Strongly recommended x
->This lovely flat is every bit as good as it appears on the listing.  Super stylish, clean and comfortable.  Definitely going to bookmark this one for future visits to London.
->Overall great stay. The pictures within the listing are a little misleading - the layout of the flat was different and there was only one bedroom (which was advertised, but the pictures suggested that there were two bedrooms). But altogether the flat was probably one of the cleanest I've ever been to and is decorated very simply. Check-in was very easy and just down the road from the flat. The Brixton tube station is a pretty direct walk as well. Coming from the U.S., I didn't think twice when AC wasn't advertised on the listing, but opening the big balcony windows made the flat cool at night so you don't even need AC. Plus, there is a small fan in the bedroom if you are warm. Awesome stay overall!
->It's such a lovely Brixton flat,  just marvellous! I had a great stay and would love to come back. Many thanks!
->Great place for one or two people. Close to all necessary transportation. Washing machine broken unfortunately

->I greatly enjoyed my stay here, it's a very nice space with everything I needed at hand. Michael was a great host, he was always quick to respond and went out of his way to make sure I was comfortable during my stay. I recommend this studio and Michael as a host, and I'd definitely stay again. Thanks Michael!
->It was around 10-15 minutes away from the station but other than that it was a great experience. The apartment is quite small but it was comfy, warm and very clean
->Micheal is a great host and is very approachable and cooperative. He is happy to help whenever he can!
->Great place. Convenient location. 
->Very nice and cosy flat. Charming, clean and in a nice localization.
->This is a cute little apartment with all the mod cons, a quiet street and handy to public transport. The check in was smooth and Michael was responsive and easy to communicate with. I thoroughly recommend and would stay again if or when I return to London. Good value for money.
->Lovely little studio apartment well placed, nicely decorated, pefect for our couples stay thanks again 
->We had a great stay!  Yes, it was cozy, we got used to that, and the wifi worked well for us.
->Great place very close to kentishtown and Camden. Very cozy, and comfortable. We had a great time staying there. 
->My first interaction with Michael was him sending me detailed information on how to get to his office. He took the time to give me step by step directions and was patient as I made my way to met him. His place was located in a quiet residential area but still close enough to the tube. There was some restaurants and a lot of  little shops to visit along the way. The place itself was clean and well kept-up and on the main floor. The pictures are exactly as shown. The washer machine and kitchen area was helpful and appreciated. There was plenty of fresh towels and dish soap was left for our use. All the kitchen supplies looked newer and well taken care of. You are left with a detailed list of what is in the room so there are no questions. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean with lots of room for all your beauty products. If there is a problem Michael is easy to reach. He even went well and beyond in allowing me to use his printer to print somethings for our trip. The only downside would be that there was a faint smell of smoke. Michael felt it was from one of the neighbors. This is something that he personally can not control and I only mention it so if this is something that you are extremely sensitive to then this could be a problem for you. As I said we do not smoke and it was only noticeable when we walked in and after awhile it was fine and it no longer bothered us. Instead of walking straight from the tube (about 15/20 minute walk)...Take the bus #210 from Finsbury Park tube and get off 3 stops later at Crouch Hill Station. The walk from there is short - cross over the first street and then make a left. The place is on the right at the next corner. Not even a 5 minute walk.  Ask Michael and he can give you detailed street information. I would definitely stay at his place again.

->Had a fabulously stay- Cami is a lovely host, garden room is clean, quiet, and bed very very comfortable. Lots of perfect little touches: Sonos speaker, Nespresso coffee maker, toaster and mini-fridge. Would stay again in a heartbeat.
->Excellent hosts in a beautiful and luxurious garden room. A great base to explore London. We will be sure to return soon and recommend to anyone who will listen!
->I loved my stay at Camille's place and will definitely be recommending it to friends.  It was really easy to get to from Gatwick airport and had great public transport links. Only 30mins away from London bridge.  It was so spacious and beautifully decorated. Modern with lots of really nice homely touches. I slept like a log because the bed was so comfortable which was perfect after a long day of walking around London. I was really impressed with the nespresso machine and continental breakfast. Camille was the perfect host, so friendly and welcoming. Overall I can not fault my stay at Camille's place, definite value for money!
->Our trip began as an 18 day journey throughout London and Scotland. Our last 4 days, staying in Cami and Barney's back cottage, was not only the most relaxing, most comfortable-- but also the most like home. We had breakfast options that would rival any BNB, they went out of their way to get me almond milk (as I am dairy-free), a toaster (you have no idea how rare this is as an accommodations for London), a fan, an ESPRESSO MAKER and a kettle, with multiple coffee and tea options, and a water container. This space was private, comfortable, loving, homey, spacious, and clean. The bed was magically comfortable,  the area lush, the local train station the prettiest we've seen in London, and the local pub (The Wood House) fantastic! I could not recommend this place more!!! I will definitely be booking this stop the next time I visit London.
->Camille and Barney are fantastic hosts. They go above and beyond what you expect a host to do. They are warm, welcoming and do that little extra. We felt that we came to the home of friends! You cannot find a better place to stay! 
->My only complaint about Camille’s bungalow, it would be that our visit here was much too short. If we’d have known how cozy and comfortable our stay would’ve been, we would’ve stayed longer. <br/>Camille is a kind and compassionate host who went above and beyond to ensure that  our stay in London was most memorable. <br/>The bungalow is very clean and very private, located in a quiet neighborhood. When we return to London this shall be the first B&b we seek. <br/>Thank you Cami!
->Très bon séjour chez Camille. La déco est super sympa, la chambre est niquelle, les équipements modernes,  on se sent comme chez soi ! Merci pour cet accueil chaleureux !
->My friend and I stayed here for our vacation in London. This is the coziest most comfortable Airbnb we’ve had the pleasure of staying in! Cami is such a hospitable host, providing breakfast things and making sure we had everything we needed. The space was so sweet and homey we were beyond happy to have such a lovely space to return to after exploring busy London. <br/>At first we weren’t sure about staying here because it seemed far from central London but we are so glad we decided to stay here! It was so easy to get to and from London with many options for transport and there are lots of parks/restaurants/shops nearby if you just want to stay local. Cami provides information for both local and city. We would love to stay here again an highly recommend Cami’s place!
->Cami and her family were so kind and pleasant to be around. The place was clean and relaxing; the bed was SO comfortable; and my only regret is that I could not stay longer. :)
->Propre, conforme à la description et très disponible pour ses hôtes, au niveau transports une fois habitué on s’y fait très bien, je recommande.
