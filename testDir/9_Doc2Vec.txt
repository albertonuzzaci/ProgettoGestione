->Loraine was a great host. Full of knowledge of the area. Guiding me to the best of the best local eateries and the best local pub the shillelagh. <br/>A long residing visitor to the area herself. Originally from Ireland and full of Irish charm. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
->Lorraine was such a lovely and kind host. She made me feel super welcomed and made my stay feel like home even though I booked on really short notice. Thank you so much Lorraine for everything and all the best for you and Cara.
->The experience was much better than I expected. Landlady is very nice and thoughtful. There are a lot of parks near the area.
->Lorraine is a really sound lady, I really enjoyed staying with her. She's friendly, accommodating and makes you feel totally at home. Her daughter is a lovely and smiley too. The flat is on a great location, close to pubs, shops and restaurants (The Shillelagh is a great one for a decent pint of stout). I'd recommend anyone looking to explore this fantastic part of London to book Lorraine room.
->Lorraine was a great host, very kind and welcoming. The room is spacious with a view to the park. Very convenient location moments to transport link and a lot of nice shops and amenities on the door step.
->I had an amazing stay at Lorraine’s. She is so kind and thoughtful and generous, one of the best hosts I’ve had. The stay was perfect for what I was looking for!
->Lorraine was the best host i’ve ever met. She sincerely took care of me well, gave advice for adjusting to this city, and area as well. The room was also cozy and tidy. Her daughter was such a charming girl. Will never forget them. You will not regret staying in their home. Thanks for all the things you’ve done for me!
->Lorraine is a superb host and an outstanding human being. The room / apartment is cozy, clean and has a good vibe. Cats are cute and a little shy. The bed is AMAZING, one of the best I ever had. Location is cool and it really suited me, also; Church St is not too loud or crowded, people were kind and approachable, the park is really nice, and its pretty easy to get around, too. The bus stop is literally in front of the house...<br/>It depends on what you expect from London and how you live your life in general, but if you need a human-centred accommodation and a sense of calm, there you go! Thank you, Lorraine!
->Lorraine’s place is at a perfect location, very easy to get around with public transportation and walking distance to very good  restaurants. Her place is great, very clean and has everything you need. Lorraine was also very helpful since the beginning, available at all times whenever I had any questions. Totally recommend it.
->Staying with Lorraine was lovely. She is a wonderful host and an amazing person! The flat is in a great location close to many cafes, restaurants, shops and a big park. Would recommend staying here!

->Visited London for a work event and the room was perfect for my needs! Very clear and helpful instructions for checking in with a kind and accommodating host.
->The AirBnB was very central, right next to Elephant and Castle which is very well connected by transport links (tube, bus, and rail) and also very close to Borough which is a lovely neighbourhood with lots to do. The flat was very clean and the room was lovely with all the basic amenities. The check-in process was easy and flexible for times of arrival. It is very good value for money and I would recommend this AirBnB wholeheartedly.
->Tres bon séjour, j’ai apprécié la propreté, la communication avec l’hôte et la situation géographique du logement dans Londres, proche du métro et du quartier Éléphant Castle.<br/>Tres bon rapport qualité prix.
->Very convenient location
->Great stay for the price. Walkable to restaurants and pharmacies, and to the Borough Market, and close to an underground station. The kitchen and bathroom were clean, and I appreciated that the toilet and shower were in separate rooms (helpful since this listing has 4 different rented rooms). Would stay here again!
->The rooms are clean and spacious, and very conveniently located. It has a hotel-like feel, at a much-less-than-hotel price, which we really appreciated. Great for our overnight stay. Communication was accurate, clear, timely, and very agreeable.<br/>Future bookers be advised that this is a shared bathroom and kitchen accommodation, which demands that you are respectful of other guests. There is also no air-conditioning. <br/>Regardless we will likely book again, should we return to London.<br/>Thank you, to the host, Simon.
->Great stay. Flexible and being in contact was easy. Would recommend, the room was exactly like promised.
->Thanks for the stay, good location to restaurants and public transport
->Central  convenient location.  Very reasonably priced for Central London.  Clean. Excellent communication from host. Because of central location some noise is expected do maybe not suitable for light sleepers. Great for a short stay. Althoughit is a shared bathroom this was never a problem it was always vacant when I needed to use it .
->Very good

->Room was dangerously hot. It was a heatwave at the time, so I didn’t expect a cool room, but when I arrived, the door and window was closed, so the room had been cooking all day.<br/>The window could only be opened an inch or so, and provided no relief from the heat.<br/>I appreciate that it won’t have air con, however with how hot the room is, they should have at least offered a fan, or admitted that it was too hot to rent out safely and closed bookings.<br/>The host wouldn’t know this though, as there appeared to be no one on site, even when another guest was having issues checking in.<br/>I ended up sleeping on the floor on the (admittedly quite comfortable) carpet, as this was the coolest part of the room.<br/>The blinds in the room offer little more than privacy, and whilst expecting blackout curtains would be unreasonable, something a little more substantial would give guests a chance at sleeping before it is totally dark outside.<br/>I raised these concerns with the host at 4am on the first morning, advising them that I would like to cancel my second night due to the above issues. They did not respond until I put in a formal request to amend my booking through the Airbnb app, which the host denied within minutes, saying that my “personal heat requirements” were my problem, and suggested that other guests may want a room that warm. They told me I should by a fan myself if I didn’t want to risk heatstroke the next night.<br/>Further issues noted, include ants in the lobby, and stairs so creaky that it felt rude to climb up or down unless absolutely necessary for fear of waking the other unfortunate guests. Assuming they had not died of dehydration in their room.<br/>I’m sure this room would be ideal for those wanting a place to stay near the airport, but only in the dead of winter, when it is both cold and dark.
->굿
->굿
->I stayed here a couple of nights as I was working in the area. The place had everything I needed. <br/>Good communication and easy check-in process / access.<br/>Parking limited to two cars but parking in the neighbouring streets (subject to restrictions).<br/>Overall I am happy with my stay and it was good value for money.
->Great place to stay for a flight in the morning. Only bad thing was I struggled to sleep as the blinds didn't stop any light coming in and the heat meant as I had to have the window open there was a lot of noise from the surroundings roads.
->Really happy with my stay. So convenient and pleasant.
->Okay stay!! <br/>My request for an early Check in just for an hour was simply denied 🙅‍♂️. Expected to be a bit more accommodating.<br/>Otherwise it was clean and nice stay.<br/>Thanks
->👍🏻

REVIEWS:

->We had a confortable stay during our stay.very quiet area and short drive to city centre.the house is undergoing Rénovation wich i am sûr it will make it more pleasant<br/>The owner of the house were very nice and friendly and  welcomed us warmly .<br/>The price is reasonable compare to hotel prices in london at this time
->Host very welcoming, and helpful when needed.  Listing doesn't however mention a few important details.  This house is not smoke free, which we were not made aware of.  Due to health issues, this made our stay quite uncomfortable, and we would not have chosen it, if we had known.  There is currently significant re-modelling going on within the house, so there is no bathroom easily accessible with this room, as of yet.  Beds comfortable, bedroom clean.  No closets or storage within this bedroom.  Also, breakfast not included in price, additional cost.  Parking spaces along road side.
->Virginett is an excellent host, really enjoyed my stay at their house. Thank you for your well received hospitality. 
->V této rodině jsme strávily měsíc ve 4 lidech. Ihned po příjezdu nás majitelé domu vřele uvítali a zběžně nám ukázali dům. Náš pokoj byl pěkný, neb proč čtyři osoby velmi malý a stísněný. Je vybavený dvěmi dvoupatrovými postelemi, menší komodou a zrcadlem. Bohužel nám nebylo předem oznámeno, že v domě bude probíhat rekonstrukce, čímž bylo ovlivněno okolí domu. Interiér, který byl často zaprášený a pro jedince, kteří mají rádi svůj klid je tato rodina spíše nevhodná, neboť je poměrně hlučná a to i v pozdních nočních hodinách. Rodina bydlí v multikulturní čtvrti s veškerou občanskou vybaveností.
->De buurt was goed. Ontvangst was erg vriendelijk. We moesten onze schoenen buiten laten. Dit vonden we niet leuk. Er was nog steeds een verbouwing gaande. Douche konden we niet gebruiken. Jammer. Wc en badmeubel waren niet schoon en stofvrij gemaakt. Bedden waren niet goed in elkaar gezet en piepten en kraakten vreselijk. Erg kleine kamer voor 4 personen. 3x3 meter. Geen tafel of stoel om je kleren op te leggen. Geen gordijn voor het raam. Erg slecht allemaal. Ontbijt was voor 4 pond per persoon erg minimaal. Alleen geroosterde toast met jam of honing of pasta en cornflakes. Met thee of koffie.
->It was everything fine, Virginett and her husband very polite, and very friendly.<br/>The room it was clean and the beds good to sleep, the bathroom great,  just 5 min walk from de bus station, and 10 min by bus from the underground.<br/>There are too many shops in the center, and supermarkets.<br/>I recommend the house!
->Virginett and her family was very nice, helpful and welcoming. The room was as descripted and perfectly corresponded to my expectations with comfortable beds and a really nice bathroom on the same floor.<br/>My friends and I really enjoyed our stay and would gladly recommend Virginett as a host.<br/>Thanks again for welcomming us !
->Virginett and her family were really nice and welcoming, they made you feel like you were at home. The house was clean and comfortable. They were always ready to help and give advices. Their daughter was very nice and very helpful. The room, bathroom and kitchen are different from the pictures... they've renewed it and it's really nice and modern. Their back yard is also very nice. It was a really nice stay. Thank you!
->It was my right decision to choose Virginett's place to stay. I was here along with my spouse and two kids and everyone was very comfortable and happy. We have been guided very accurately and all of our queries were immediately resolved without any time gap before and after our check-in. <br/>It was very pleasant stay we had and many thanks to Suresh and Virginett for making us home like feeling. We found this place is more convenient for commute to central London. We have all the reasons here to choose this option when we travel back to London. Thanks again!
->Our hosts made us feel very welcome and were interested in what we were up to in London. The room was cosy and the beds comfortable (if rather squeaky!) but perhaps not the cleanest. There was a fridge for our use and access to the kitchen. <br/><br/>You get what you pay for: a nice room to stay in with a friendly family at a relatively affordable price.

->the stay was amazing ! simon is a lovely host i would definitely stay here again 😊
->Der Vermieter ist sehr hilfsbereit und antwortet schnell auf Fragen oder Probleme über den AirBnB Account. Wir brauchten noch eine Decke und ein Handtuch und es wurde am selben Tag noch hinterlegt. <br/>Lage der Wohnung ist gut. Check in problemlos mit Schlüsselbox. <br/>Zimmer und Wohnung sind jedoch schon älter. Die Bilder sind mit Weitwinkel fotografiert und vermutlich bearbeitet. Es ist in Wirklichkeit alles kleiner und schon sehr abgewohnt. Unsere Tür ging schlecht zu, da das Holz auf der Rahmenseite halb rausgebrochen ist. Wir hatten Zimmer Trafalgar Square. Die Fenster gehen nur max. 10 cm auf. Falls sie zu sind und gar nicht aufgehen, dann den Vermieter fragen,  er hat Schlüssel dazu. <br/>In der Unterkunft gibt es vier Zimmer, bei Vollbelegung waren zu unserer Zeit 11 Personen in der gesamten Wohnung mit einem kleinen Bad,  Mini WC und kleiner Küche. Dafür ist das Preis Leistungsverhältnis nicht angemessen finde ich. <br/>Für 1-2 Nächte ok.
->It was a nice room and a comfortable bed<br/>👍🏼 and the place was clean
->This was absolutely perfect for what I needed! Incredible location, clean and easy to find! Would 100% stay here again!
->A very decent accomodation in London's Zone 1 for it's price. Our kind remark is to take more seriously the check-in part with the main-key-method as the key was not where it was described and the mentionned phone numbers were not responding in our need to solve that. A responsive host would otherwise make this accomodation a 5*.
->Location is great. Simon is good at replying quickly and is helpful. Just be aware that it’s a small place and when fully occupied it’s a little crowded. Overall good for what you pay for.
->Es tal cual como la foto, el edificio por fuera está un poco descuidado pero está bien, el baño es compartido con los otros huéspedes, Simon es muy amable y responde tus dudas, lo recomiendo para estancias cortas ya que es algo pequeño y si no te gusta compartir baño tal vez sea un poco molesto, hay cocina y lavadora
->De bnb van Simon heeft een mooie locatie om via de zuid kant London te ontdekken. In zijn flat zijn vier bnb kamers ingericht, waardoor er veel mensen gebruik moeten maken van de voorzieningen. Daarbij zijn de kamers basic en niet erg comfortabel ingericht. Simon reageert snel via de bnbapp bij problemen, dat is was fijn.
->This was a lovely stay! Everything was as portrayed online and it’s a great location. The host responded to our messages quickly and seemed very friendly. I would recommend this stay to anyone wanting to visit London:)

->Fantastic stay.. apartment clean and very quirky. Host was brilliant and very helpful with any questions.
->Andrea's listing was a great choice for a homely comfort stay over holidays amidst the lockdown restrictions as we majorly had to stay indoors during the length of our entire stay. It was an extremely home-like, comfortable and cozy stay with a lot of accessories and tools available at our disposal for daily use at the apartment. Tesco and few local shops are a few steps away making it an excellent choice for accessing basic necessities. Andrea was extremely generous and was available to assist us with any queries we had.

->I could not be more thankful for a great experience with this family. It was my first time using air bnb and absolutely thank my host for making me feel right at home. They were helpful from the time I entered the door until I left. If I'm ever in London again I'm definitely staying with them again! 
->Virginett's house was undergoing decoration but I was welcomed properly.<br/>i had a good chat with her husband on the final day and he kindly drove me to the bus stop, saving me from a 16 minute walk with a heavy bag.
->I had a very pleasant stay - Virginett and her family were very nice and helpful, the room was good. Thank you very much for welcoming me!
->I am so grateful to Virginett and her family. It was a last minute request and they were gracious enough to accept my booking.<br/>Their location was great for where I needed to travel to [I was heading to Kingston University], and is generally easy to get to. Virginett was also kind enough tot stay up and chat with me until 1 am Saturday! I really enjoyed the conversation; chats like these are the most enjoyable. <br/><br/>They're a family of musicians and dancers, of which I did not know until after I arrived. I'll stay longer next time. Hopefully then I'll be able to chat more about the arts and culture, and listen to the family play.<br/><br/>The room was exactly as you see it in the picture, and the house is spacious.
->HOST:<br/><br/>Virginett and her entire family are incredibly warm and friendly people. I only stayed for a couple of nights while my permanent residence was being prepared, but they were very sweet to me during that time. They were eager to help with information on the surrounding area, letting me know the location of close-by routes and amenities. They made me feel at home the moment I walked through the door - they're just lovely friendly people.<br/><br/>THE ROOM: <br/><br/>Is as pictured. It's actually slightly bigger in person than it seems to be in the photo. It was very warm and comfortable and very clean. Peaceful street meant a well needed good night's rest.<br/><br/>The AREA:<br/><br/>Being a quiet neighbourhood down in Mitcham, there's limited choice for eating/shopping in the surrounding area. But it's London - everything is just a quick transit ride away. I enjoy walks and made it to Streatham in about 30mins walking. Otherwise there's frequent buses that can get you to Tooting Broadway in about 20mins.<br/><br/>Everything about this place is great! The two things that strike out are the incredibly warm and welcoming family (made me a little less homesick) and the insanely cheap  price for the room. I was so happy they took me on with such short notice. Peaceful, peaceful stay.<br/><br/>Thanks to the entire family!
->2週間の滞在でした。<br/>彼らはとても親切なご家族です。<br/>彼らの国の伝統の料理「ストリングホッパー」(米粉で作られた麺をスパイシーな数種の野菜ソースでからめて食べる、もちろん手で食べる料理)をごちそうしてくださいました。<br/>部屋は思ったよりも大きくて、すこし独特の匂いがしましたが、ほとんど快適に過ごせました。<br/>特に、お父さんは非常に親切で心優しい方です。会うたびに、「Hello,Koki! How are you!」と声をかけて、世間話やさまざまな必要な情報を与えてくれました。<br/>また、頼んだらキッチンや机なども貸してくださり、不自由なく過ごせました。Wi-Fiもすべての部屋に届いています。<br/>近くにco-operativeのスーパーマーケットがあり、夜でもそこそこ遅くまでやってるので、食材はそこで安く買って調理しました。<br/>バス停からも徒歩3分ほど。<br/>素敵なロンドンライフをありがとうございました。<br/>I stayed in this room for 2 weeks.<br/>They are very kind family. They served me a dinner, string hoppers(which is the noodle with spicy vegetable sauce. the noodle is made of rice powder and tastes very very nice. it is the traditional dinner in their country).<br/>The room is larger than I thought, and I spend comfortable time.<br/>And they let me use kitchen and desk to use my RapTop.<br/>Wi-Fi is the service also you can use.<br/>And a co-operative supermarket is near by this house so that I could buy some foods to cook in the kitchen.<br/>Bus stop is near by here, just 3 minutes by walk.<br/>Thank you for very nice London Life, Virginet Family.<br/>(I'm sorry that my very poor English ability. I didn't use the Translation App.)
->Virginett and her family were absolutely amazing! She helped me plan transportation to and from the airport, and was more than welcoming during my entire stay! I even had an issue with my flight and had to stay another night and they took me in free of charge! Like a home away from home! Very easy to get into London from this location and Virginett is very quick to respond to any questions or concerns. Highly recommend to anyone planning a trip to London!
->It's always a pleasure staying with Virginett and her family.
->I have stayed with Virginett and I would definitely recommend her to others.
->I had a very pleasant stay for a fair price. The family were very welcoming and I would recommend staying with Virginett if in London for any reason.

->This was a disaster but I will tell you why I will give it one more try:<br/>I booked the hotel because of location. Also price was attractive and of course based on photos it looked amazing. Whole hotel concept is great, I just wish they offer breakfasts as well but, and here it went wrong.<br/>I arrived to check in and receptionist didn’t know what to do. Fair to say she claimed I was first Airbnb guest. She have me the key from room and I went to check it out. When I opened the door, I thought she is joking. Room was empty. No sheets, no pillow, no blanket and bathroom was not cleaned. And of course no decor as presented on photos. I returned on reception and explained the problem, but I got answer this is the only room they have. I had to push hard to receptionist to start solving this so she called her manager and offered I can have a blanket, but there is no one to clean the room. I refused since the room was really, really filthy and towels and toiletries was missing as well.<br/>After a while me asking her to cancel my booking and leaving to hotel she called her manager again and offered then a different room. I went to check it out to find out this is a room from a photo so nice surprise! There the good news ended since bathroom was cleaned very poorly, someone’s toothbrush and toothpaste has been on the sink and filth and long dark hairs was everywhere. Spots and hairs on sheets was something I simply no surprise after that. Some personal belongings in the room... well. <br/>Worst think happen in the morning about 7:30 when somebody opened my room’s doors with the card and entered when I was at bathroom. Can imagine worth privacy breaking than that, honestly. So evidently, the lock on the door does not prevent anyone with the card entering your room. No privacy. <br/>I complained in the morning on the reception where happen to be manager of the hotel. He explained his point of view of the whole situation and described that as big series of miscommunication. Well, it still happened.<br/>Believe or not, I still believe the hotel would be great if proper housekeeping would be done and management work on communication and privacy issues.<br/>That’s why I will give it a one more shot. But currently, I cannot recommend it at all.

->Truly a hidden gem in the midst of Notting Hill. I was incredibly impressed by the apartment - it was clean, cute, central and so affordable. You could see the buzz of portobello in front of your window whilst dwelling the tranquillity of your room. The best part however was the extras: Genji made sure nothing was missing: I got towels, toiletries and even slippers. The kitchen was packed with tea, coffee, cake, even ramen and miso soup - neatly labeled and ordered. Very impressed and would recommend 1001%.

->L'alloggio è davvero vicinissimo alla stazione di bermondsey sulla jubilee, il che la rende facilmente accessibile a tutto, ovunque vogliate andare sarete a pochissimi minuti di metro ;) il quartiere è tranquillo e molto pratico, di fianco ha un fish&chips, di fronte un ristorante take away, e più supermercati a basso prezzo nei paraggi, le ragazze, lasciano casa al mattino e rientrano la sera, quindi si possono usare sia la doccia che la cucina con comodità. Sono ragazze inglesi e giovani, quindi non proprio ordinate, ma vi accorgerete che vivono un po' tutti così lì, quindi non aspettatevi un albergo,ma sono molto disponibili, sia a consigli su cosa fare, sia se vi manca qualcosa come il phon, o simili, nel complesso siamo stati bene.

->Clean room, really detailed instructions and friendly host. <br/>My complaint is sadly that the road noise in the rooms is quite loud and as I'm a bit sensitive to traffic noise I didn't sleep well.  Markito offered to let me move rooms and was very accommodating but I'd check first if you are a bit of a light sleeper.
->Fast communication. Perfect check in process. Clean.
->The house was nice and clean. We didn't meet Markito but he was been taking care about us, giving us the necessary information about the house and was and a great experience. I will 100% recommended.
->Expect a relaxed stay from start to finish , no fuss whatsoever in terms of finding my room, checking in, or checking out - excellent communication throughout, and a good host overall! 
->Habitation vraiment à coter du london bridge et donc excentré du centre, en 20mn on est au centre avec le métro. Appartement super propre et calme, bon wifi, cadenas sur les portes, proche d'épiceries et de supermarché. bon plan.
->Markito is a really nice person and helps us a lot. The location is convenience and the room is clean and nice. We spent a wonderful night.
