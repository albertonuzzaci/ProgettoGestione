->Rafael es un anfitrión encantador. Es muy agradable y siempre se muestra dispuesto a ayudar. El apartamento es tal y como se describe en el anuncio. Está muy bien ubicado. Sin duda, en caso de volver, repetiríamos la estancia en el apartamento de Rafael.
->Rafael is super easy going cool guy :D <br/>The place is what it is showed, area is a bit sketchy at night, but the flat is well for a stay in London. <br/>Accessible by metro very near and first necessity provided. And room very quiet.<br/>Good value ;)
->Rafael is an easygoing guy and the communication was excellent throughout. The room is just like in the description. Lively neighbourhood with an outdoor market on the same road. Nothing to complain about!
->Perfect pad for what I needed. Raphael was easy to deal with
->不錯的位置，高性價比，Rafael也很樂於助人，周圍的環境多樣，你可能見到一些怪怪的人，但是安全、熱鬧和正常。超市和車站也很近，你可以找到一切生活所需
->Rafael's place is just as it looks. The location's not the best, but he is a great host and the apartment is clean, the room is accurate as compares to the pictures, and Rafael as a host is super friendly and easy to communicate with.
->Very good value,  exactly as advertised
->A good option if you’re on a budget but still want good location. In the middle of dalston market and lots around the area.
->Communication was easy and the lockbox was easily located with photos. The room itself was clean. The front door key however was difficult and took a few tries to open each time as the door was quiet flimsy. You also had to lock it after you and in the event of a fire would have been difficult to exit quickly. The room itself is the hosts room and he stays on a sofa bed with a partition in the shared living area. I know that this is how some airbnbs are, but I do not feel that this was made clear in the description and we may not have booked it had we known. There was a lock on the outside of the door to the bedroom for when you leave but no lock on the inside. This did not feel safe and had I been a lone female traveller would have felt more comfortable if there was a lock on the inside for when sleeping, and if I couldn't be locked in from the outside. The surrounding area isn't great either so again probably isn't ideal if you were a single female. <br/>In general, if you need just a bed to sleep in for the night it is a cheap stay in London and the room is clean and towels were provided. Otherwise the advert needs to be clearer on the set up and I felt it doesn't meet the basic standards I would expect from an airbnb.
->Rafael is a very nice host. Great communication.

->Ce fut PARFAIT!<br/>Carmen et Volker nous ont accueillis chaleureusement dans leur grand appartement de standind au coeur de Londres.<br/>Propreté, renseignements tout a été génial.<br/>Merci à eux pour ce week-end top.<br/>A recommander 100000 fois!
->Himari, our baby son and I had a wonderful stay in Carmens and Volkers place. Really modern, elegant, spacy, clean and in a good place to find your way to any place in the city - in other words: very central. The next station is 3 minutes away and there are lots of interesting cultural places. However, the best was the friendly attitude of Volker (unfortunately Carmen was abroad) who even prepared a baby bed for our son. On top of that he had arranged nappies and baby ointment since he knows what babies need because of his own kids. We were happy to use their spacious kitchen which was well organized and had anything needed for breakfast! At the end of our time we celebrated our stay in a local restaurant! Definitely recommended! 
->My stay with Carmen & Volker was my first Air B&B experience and it was amazing. My hosts were welcoming, friendly and relaxed while making sure that I was happy and had everything I needed during  my stay. My room in their beautiful apartment was perfect and I felt completely at home and treated to lots of nice things for breakfast. The location in Dalston is perfect for anybody who wants to experience East London and easy access to all areas of the city via the new Dalston train service. I stayed for work and I would 100% recommend the apartment and hope to have the opportunity to stay there again. 
->Exactly like the description. Exactement comme sur les photos et le descriptif ! comme à l'Hotel, à une minute à pied du métro et des bus. Expérience incroyable pour un prix modique. Merci
->I enjoy staying at Carmen's home, it's comfortable place and close to overground station.  You can help youself for the breakfast with coffee and tea.  The house is nice and clean. Thanks for Carmen and her family especially two lovely kids.  They gave me lots of advice for my sight-seeing in London.
->Carmen and her family are all lovely people. She is really nice to me and prepared a lot of food in the fridge for me to eat anytime incase i'm hungry in the middle of the night. Her kids are also lovely and cute.<br/><br/>The room is really good. It's so spacious and the bed was great. You also got your own bathroom during the stay. The apartment is just right besides the overground station. Its really easy to get access to any place in London. <br/><br/>I'd love to stay in Carmen's place once again if i ever have a chance to visit london again! :)
->Carmen's descriptions were part of the reason I chose to stay at her place.  Besides the appeal at the type of accommodations she was offering, the nuances in her writing suggested to me that these were honest and detail-oriented people.  Indeed they are honest, perceptively accommodating, and friendly people to boot!   My husband and I had a lovely stay in London, thanks in part to our eager hosts.  Everything is very clean and inviting.  The bed is wonderfully comfortable.  And the offerings at breakfast in the living space are delightful.  Carmen and Volker are comfortable to be around.  They will sit and chat with you, and help you figure your way in London, or they will give you your space and privacy.  ...  This was our airbnb trial and in certain ways, it beats the hotel experience.  Now we feel like we have friends in London.  :-)
->This was the best Airbnb experience so far! Carmen and her family were extremely nice and thoughtful. Room was perfectly prepared. Amazing separate bathroom (with fresh towels every morning), full breakfast, any imaginable snacks etc — every tiny detail was already considered, so we just felt us at home. Gorgeous apartment as well as the building and area itself... Well, this is just the finest Airbnb representation! 
->It was my first experience in airbnb. Excellent housting for my mum and sister.<br/>Carmen, Volker  and their children are welcoming, friendly and warm people. Carmen is really nice, funny and considered. <br/>My Mum and sister didn´t have any problem communicating with them  even though my family didn´t speak any english. (there were some funny situation)<br/>They made us feel at home, in confidence.<br/>My family really enjoyed and rested very confortably there, in a beautiful room with batroom (fresh towels every day) The flat is clean,spacious and brightly.<br/>The Location is perfect and easy acces to all areas of the city.<br/>100% recommend

->My stay at Laura's was perfect.  The apartment was clean, modern and comfortable, and perfectly located near the Hackney overground and near so many great restaurants and pubs.  Laura was friendly, responsive and beyod accommodating.  I would happily return next time I visit London!<br/>
->Laura's apartment is fantastic. It's clean, well-furnished, trendy, and close to public transit. The separate room and private bath are set up such that I had loads of privacy and plenty of space to myself. The immediate bar and food scene around her apartment, Dalston, is vibrant and loved getting to see another angle of London outside the standard tourist scene. Finally, Laura is lovely. She immediately welcomed me into her home with a beer and conversation. I felt very much at home and would highly recommend.
->Perfect room in the perfect apartment. Couldn't fault a single thing, close walking distance to Hackney Central/Downs stations which makes it easy to get around. 
->Laura's place is new, clean, spacious and light. And she has decorated it to be stylish and cool. The bedroom has a big private balcony and a huge bathroom with bath. Plus Laura herself is really welcoming and thoughtful. You can't beat the location, between two train stops, above a supermarket and right by loads of bars and cafes. Stay here!
->This place was great. Laura was super helpful, wonderful advise on places to eat, things to see and was really easy to contact. The place was clean, close to some cool places and two translations. <br/>Walking distance from some cool bars and a beautiful cinema.<br/>Would stay again 10/10.
->I had a great time, the flat is beautiful and comfortable.<br/>It was easy to get to central London with public transportation.<br/>Laura made sure I had everything I needed.<br/>Highly recomnended!
->Amazing stay at Laura's stylish, clean, cozy apartment. Super convenient to get to central London with two tube stations nearby. Flat is close to many great restaurants, bars, and arthouse cinema. Prompt communication and flexible check-in/check-out time. It was great to meet you Laura, hope we cross paths again!
->I had a great stay at Laura's place for 3 weeks. It's in a good location very close to 2 trains and lots of buses. The flat is spacious, clean, warm and nicely decorated, and I liked being able to use the gym. Laura was welcoming and gave me lots of good tips about London.
->I thoroughly recommend staying with Laura. It's a beautiful apartment and I never felt like I was imposing. Great kitchen bench to do some work from. Easy to get places. Easy to find.
->Awesome apartment in the perfect location. Close to two overground stops as well as lots of great bars and cafes close by. <br/>Laura is super friendly and welcoming, and was a big help with local knowledge. Would definitely stay again. Highly recommend!

->Annie is an amazing host and the location was easily accessible through public transit. Would definitely recommend for solo or couple travelers!
->We liked the position of the house it is close to park, public transport, cafes and market. We’d like to mention that bed is great, we had very good sleep. But you are living with other people as mentioned in the description and they were loud until quite late (after midnight). Also, though they were smoking outside, we felt smell in the house but not in our room. As mentioned in the description you are living in the owners room and there were no place for our staff. Bad was clean, but floor in our room wasn’t.<br/>For such price we’ve been living in better conditions.
->Wir haben uns bei Annie sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Mitbewohner waren sehr nett und hilfsbereit, wir haben insgesamt aber wenig von ihnen mitbekommen außer bewusst für einen Plausch in der Küche. Das Haus hat insgesamt drei Stockwerke. Die Küche befindet sich ganz unten im Untergeschoss  (Halbparterre) und das Zimmer ganz oben (1. Stock). Im Sommer ist die Lage der Küche sicher ideal, da hinten der kleine Garten/Hof rausgeht und es eher kühl ist. Jetzt im Winter hat das etwas an Gemütlichkeit genommen. Annies Zimmer war klein aber fein, es ist nett eingerichtet und war genau nach unserem Geschmack. Das Bad ist auf derselben Etage und sehr geschmackvoll und sauber. Das Haus ist insgesamt eher urig, die Wände sind dünn, es knatscht hier und da, muss man mögen. Für junge offene Leute, die ein paar Tage London erkunden wollen, ein idealer <br/>und authentischer Rückzugsort, auch wegen der ruhigen aber zentralen Nachbarschaft.Gerne wieder!

->Our stay at Ruth's place was wonderful. The apartment is absolutely beautiful, and the room we stayed at was cute and clean. The neighbourhood is nice and peaceful, within a walking distance from Hackney Central and Victoria Park, with quite good connections to the rest of the city as well.

->Lovely short stay near Broadway market. Located just along the canal with access to multiple parks and within walking distance to great restaurants/shops. I worked remote for a couple of days and was able to chat with Victoria. I had access to my own desk and the common areas. Victoria responds quickly and allowed me to check in early which I was grateful for after the flight. I would love to stay here again.
->Victoria was a great host and the place was lovely<br/>Good and efficient communication
->Absolutely beautiful flat with lots of lovely comforting and beautiful touches.

Thanks so much for having me as a guest. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for a stylish and comfortable pied a terre in east London.
->Everything about staying at Victoria's place was outstanding. Victoria is the consummate host and made feel so at home. Her beautiful modern apartment is impeccably decorated and the room was spacious and perfectly suited to my combination of needs (work +stay). The local area was also a real highlight -one of the friendliest areas in London with so many great restaurants, pubs and more. 11/10!
