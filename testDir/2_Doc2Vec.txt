->Great place, very friendly people. Room as shown. Very good overall.
->Fabiano made my stay most agreeable, he was generous, available, helpful , he did his best to make me feel at home; the room was cosy and the location handy, at walking distance to and from Kensington high street, Holland Park  and bus stops; I recommend Fabiano's place.<br/><br/>
->I had the most wonderful restfull stay with Fabiano. He is very easy going and welcoming.  The apt is very clean and tidy and the room was comfortable especially the bed.  It had everything you need including a minibar! I enjoyed meeting Fabianos lovely friends who were also warm and friendly.  I deff hope to return again soon.  Thank you Fabiano you are a great host.
->I really enjoyed my stay with Fabiano. He made me feel incredibly comfortable and at home. As it was first first air bnb experience I was a little apprehensive staying in someones home and was worried about feeling uncomfortable, however Fabiano ensured I did not feel this way. The room is a great size with a very comfy bed, tv and a desk which was so handy when i had work to do in the eve ing. I loved that Fabiano had a mini bar in my room with bottled water and cans of coke along with some snacks. I really appreciated the extra effort. Fabiano even offered me home cooked meals each night.<br/>Fabiano made so much effort and was so gentle and kind, it was a pleasure to stay in his home. My only regret is that I was so busy during my stay, I would have liked to spend more time there!<br/>Thank you Fabiano,  I would love to stay with you again next time I am in London! 
->It was just a 10/10 stay. Bed and pillows super comfortable, spacious and spotless room. But the most important part was that he made me feel like a friend in a friend's house. Available and very respectul, friendly and nice, could not have been better! We also had an aperitivo together with his friends. His dog is lovely. I can only say the best about Fabiano and about his hospitality. The place is 5 minutes away (walking) from Sheperd's Bush tube station and 3 minutes far from bus 49 stop. This was the first time I used AirBnb and I was really delighted.
->Fabiano was very kind and caring to make it possible to get the keys for the room at an convenient time for us and in general being a good host! We enjoyed the stay!

->超级棒的位置 Sophia也超级好
->Very gracious and accommodating host in a nice, central location. Stayed for over one month, and it was a very easy, safe and comfortable experience!
->Location and price can not be beat!  It was a great place to stay.
->Great location! Walking distance to Hyde Park, V&A, Natural History and even RA Hall, etc. I had a great time here and the hosts are awesome!
->This is one of the best location in London. 3 -5 walk to tube station, shopping mall,  hyde park.<br/>Sophia is a very nice and friendly host. She provided good recommendations on attractions in UK<br/>The house is clean and equipped with everything you need. I give plus point to comfy bed<br/>I ll definitely come back to her place if I happen to be in London again.
->Amazing location and spacious room. <br/>Great for short stays!
->What a fabulous location! Literally across the street from Harrods, a stone's throw from the Tube, and even 2 small grocery stores right there. Brompton Road is crazy busy day and night, but the room was very quiet. Plenty of room to hang stuff and put put things in drawers. Sophie was kind and helpful. I loved the super-comfortable bed. The building was secure with a locked lobby and a doorman who was very attentive to the security of the building. All in all, highly recommended and very good value compared to the outrageous prices of hotels and other rentals in the area. Thank you Sophie and Happy New Year!
->Perfect location, spacious room. Sophia is a wonderful, kind, friendly host.
->great location
->Great hosts, convenient to Harrods and Hyde Park, but old building, tight space, plumbing problems, and far from other tourist sites.

->I had a great stay at Ranj's flat. He keeps it extremely clean and it is very conveniently located. Only downside was some of the neighbors were very loud late in the night. But the flat itself was great. 
->Ranj is very friendly and helpful. I've only spent one night at his place and we've seen each other only briefly, so there's not much I can say.
->Ranj was a perfect host. Highly recommended to stay there with easy access to Central London 
->Ranj si è reso molto disponibile al momento del mio arrivo venendo a prendermi alla fermata della metro. Purtroppo nei giorni successivi non abbiamo avuto occasione di incontrarci ma per qualsiasi necessità è sempre stato reperibile al telefono. 
->This flat was perfectly located for me when I was working in the area, it's less than 5 minutes to the tube station. The room was bright and spacious and having a kitchen was great. Ranj and I didn't really see each other much, but he was always available by text/phone if I needed anything and he also picked me up at the underground station, which was nice.
->Great place, great host, great value!
->Ranj was helpful on my arrival, even though it was not the check in time, we let me in. I didn't see him that much, although he responded to my enquiries quickly. The room is really spacious and it has this big window. Despite the building the bedroom is quite comfortable and the neighborhood is quite, close to Portobello and Notting Hill. The closest tube station is Latimer Road, just around the corner. <br/>I like the location of the house very much. 
->My stay at Ranj's apartment was great for me. Very calm and clean. Location is very good too. I would definitely come back.
->Tl:dr: great location, cozy room, great owner <br/>I was there for 2 nights, easily slept like a baby because the room was cozy enough. <br/>Ranj gave me a warm welcomed and even guided me to use the best route(bus) to the central city. For the next 2 days, I'd only used that route because I found it to be cheaper and better than the train. <br/>I wasn't much at his accommodation during the day, but the last day I was greeted by a sunny morning with sunlight through the room's beautiful wide windows! <br/>All in all, was a good experience here, but could be better with stronger shower water Haha.
->The second time I stayed here, and it was, as before, perfect for me. Great place, value and view. <br/>

->This place is a gem and it was a privilege to be Ian's first guest.  The description and pictures do not do justice to the spacious nature of the bedroom and bathroom.  Everything was immaculate and Ian couldn't have done anymore to make me feel welcome and ensured that I had everything I could possibly have wanted.  I thoroughly recommend this place, the best Air bnb I have stayed in.

->Host was pleasant. Bedroom and bathroom are of a superior quality, clean  and spacious. 
->Another wonderful stay, thank you.
->It's the first time I've used Airbnb and feel very lucky to have had such a fantastic first experience. Ian was extremely helpful and was a first class host. The room and private bathroom were clean and well equipped and in a great location, just a few minutes from paddington station. Will be returning in the future. Highly recommend. 
->Ian and his dog was very friendly and welcoming. I had to find my stay on the day, and he kindly let me check in as early as possible.<br/>The place was comfy as well.

->Jenny was very welcoming and provided us a clean, lovely room in excellent condition. The whole house is fully refurbished and very clean. Jenny has offered us a wide variety of breakfast like cereal, yoghurt, toast, orange juice, etc. I recommend staying here to everyone.<br/><br/>
->La habitación de Jenny es exactamente como publica en su anuncio. Aún mejor, porque dispone de un armario empotrado para poder dejar la ropa, dos ventanales geniales que dan a la tranquila calle en la que vive y mucho espacio vital. El lavabo está justo al lado, no hay que hacer ningún desplazamiento a otra planta. La casa está totalmente reformada. Es muy bonita y acogedora. Está todo muy limpio y sobre todo, sobre todo, la cama es de lujo total. El colchón es muy cómodo, de manera que se descansa genial después de un día de visita por la ciudad. <br/>La casa se encuentra ni a cinco minutos de la estación de Victoria. La ventaja de su ubicación no sólo es que está muy céntrica, sino que además se encuentra en una calle muy tranquila, sin apenas tráfico, de casas típicas. En una de las esquinas hay un pub muy auténtico. Y en las dos, tres calles colindantes, hay todo tipo de servicios (restaurantes, supermercados, etc.). <br/>Jenny es una gran anfitriona. Nos ha atendido muy bien, y nos ha dado siempre y en todo momento las indicaciones que le hemos pedido. El último día, cuando ya habíamos hecho el check out nos dejó la llave de casa para que pudiéramos volver a buscar el equipaje por la tarde. Su hijo es una monada!<br/>El desayuno está bien completo: nespresso, tes, pan, mermeladas, cereales de todo tipo, fruta, zumo, leche, yogurt... genial para empezar el día. <br/>La verdad es que ha sido una experiencia genial en todos los sentidos. Nos encantó que Jenny, el último día, nos sentara y nos preguntará qué mejoraríamos de su estancia. Tiene muchas ganas de hacerlo bien y eso se agradece muchísimo. <br/>El precio de la habitación, con el desayuno incluido, está muy bien en relación a los precios londinenses y sin olvidar que está en pleno centro.<br/>La valoración final general es de excelente. <br/>
->Beautiful house in a great part of London. Jenny was welcoming and thoughtful. Comfy and quiet room, the chocolates on the pillow was a lovely touch. 
->Nous étions un couple à passer quatre nuits chez Jenny. Nous avons été accueilli comme si nous étions à la maison avec une petite attention à notre arrivée.<br/><br/>L'appartement est bien situé, à 5 minutes du métro ou du bus. Un supermarché est disponible dans les rues alentours ainsi que de nombreux restaurants et pubs.<br/><br/>La chambre dans laquelle nous avons dormi est spacieuse et le lit y est très confortable. <br/><br/>Jenny propose un petit déj avec un large choix (pain, confitures, beurre, céréales, fruit, yaourt) et est très agréable<br/>Le rapport qualité/prix est parfait.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------<br/><br/>We were a couple to spend four nights at Jenny .

->Jenny was a lovely host and the room was clean and nice. She gave us a spare mattress so an extra person could stay in the room and was very helpful with advice of places visit. The house is nice and airy and the family made us feel very welcome and Jenny even went out and bought extra food for breakfast when we suggested it!<br/><br/>The house was really central and plenty of nice restaurants to go to nearby when we were too tired to search further afield.
->We had such a lovely days stay with Jenny! Highly recommend her place! 
->I spent three wonderful days at Jenny's house. She and her parents were really  wonderful with me.<br/><br/>Thanks a lot
->Jenny and her family was the sweetest host I have ever had. Communication prior to our arrival was extremely smooth and she provided me with very clear directions to her house. Upon arrival, Jenny, her adorable son, and her parents greeted my friend and I with open arms. The bedroom is very spacious and the king-size bed felt like I was sleeping on clouds. The shared bathroom was very nice as well. In the morning, she provided us with breakfast (toast, yogurt, cereal) and tea/coffee. She made sure we were comfortable and she gave us suggestions on places to see in London. The location is very convenient as well as it is walking distance to Victoria Station. I recommend this listing to anyone looking for an enjoyable stay in London.

REVIEWS:

->We had a wonderful time! Great location!
->Loved the location, easy to get around and experience London. We could easily walk to Notting Hill, Oxford Street, Hyde Park, etc.
->Ideal for weekend break
->Location, early check-in and prompt communication are the best features of this property. Cleanliness and comfort unfortunately are not. A lumpy, sagging mattress coupled with dusty, unclean surfaces and old bedding didn't make for the best experience.<br/>Upon request, Ali did provide replacement sheets and towels but the mattress definitely needs replacing.
->Points forts :Très bon emplacement très bon quartier, pour le prix dans ce quartier c'est vraiment top à 3 minutes de Hyde park.<br/>Points faibles: Concernant la chambre juste de quoi dormir, pour le lit il ne faut pas être trop grand ni trop exigeant pour le confort, l'appartement est en souplex, il y a une forte odeur de cave (humidité refermé). Je vous recommande tout de même ce logement de fait du prix et de l'emplacement.
->Small but with all you need for three days. The apartment is like the<br/>photografies and the ubication is fine. We would come back!!
->The place is located in a great area, near to public transportation and also restaurants and shops. It’s a small studio and has all the amenities needed, even that an adapter would be a plus as I could not use some of my personal devices which were requiring a different kind of adapter. Also I think that the hair dryer has some issues as it would stop after 30 seconds of using it, and I had to wait a couple of minutes so I could use it again. Overall we are ok with what we have paid as in this area the prices are a lot higher, but would have expected to be a little more clean. There were some stains on the walls, next to the bed and also some on the bathroom’s floor. Due to the fact that the studio does not have a window so that the fresh air can enter, there was also a strange smell when entering the room.
->Muy pequeño, más de lo que parece en las fotos, y sobretodo poca ventilación, faltaba el aire aun teniendo la ventana abierta que da a un patio cerrado. Pocos utensilios y regular en general. Buena comunicación
->Dieses kleine süße Appartment ist super für eine kleine Städtereise. Es ist sauber mit etwas muffigem geruch. Das Fenster war zu öffnen, auch wenn dadruch nicht sehr viel luft kam. Für sehr große Menschen ist dieses Appartment meiner Meinung nach nicht zu empfehlen. Es könnte sehr eng werden. <br/>Ansonsten hat man alles, was man für ein paar Tage London braucht. Supermärkte (Tesco) in der Nähe. Paddington Underground 5-10 Gehminuten entfernt.

->Neried was very kind, responsible, helping person. She was always ready to help and assist in different situations. The room was really comfortable, clean, light. We also had the own bathroom. It was not noisy as the window had the view in the yard. Very suitable to arrive from Heathrow and to the heart of London. You can walk to the Buckingham Palace through the Hyde Park. 
->I really had great time staying at Neried house:<br/>First, Neried was very welcoming and she is a very warm person, who explained everything I needed to know about how to get places ,or where to eat, and in general, helped me with what I needed patiently.<br/>It was also great talking to her. She really made me feel like home!<br/>The room is clear and there are plenty of hot water, you can do the laundry, which really helped, and the living room is very nice and tidy, exactly like in the pictures. <br/>The location is very good- Kensington HighStreet considered to be a very nice area, the location is 10min walk from the tube, but there are about 7 bus lines that take you from the tube exactly in front of the house, so it is very convenient.<br/>There are a lot of restuarants in the area- Thai/Indian/Italian/French/Burgers/bakeries supermarkets and even a 24h Macdonald's --just pick one!<br/> There are also many stores of all kind in the street, which was nice to explore.<br/>
->The place is such a great location with a 5 minute walk to the tube. I was impressed by the good quality sheets and towels that were provided as well. Neried friend Susy greeted me and provided me a good run down of the place. I would recommend staying here. Good value for money. 
->Neried is an awesome hostess.
->The room was clean and nice with private bathroom and everything you need, location is excellent, on High Street Kensington.<br/>Neried wasn't home but the communication was excellent and she provided me all the details I asked.<br/>I am very satisfied with my stay there.
->Nerieds home was extremely last minute for me but never the less she organised it for me in the matter of three hours or so. The room was super tidy and clean despite the last minute arrangements. She truly is a super host and I could not be more grateful for her kindness and her hospitality.
->I had a wonderful stay at Neried's flat. The flat itself is in a perfect location; 5-10 min walk to multiple tube stations and bus stops right outside the front of the flat. There are endless shops a few minutes walk down Kensington High Street for everything you need, whether it be groceries, somewhere to grab lunch or some clothes shopping. The room and ensuite itself was lovely, great quality linen and towels provided as well as heaps of storage space. The room was so quiet and clean, especially with the cleaner coming to visit. Although I didn't get to meet Neried herself in person (I was staying with two other lovely guests), the communication with her was great, and she was so quick to help or fix any issues that needed to be resolved. I can't recommend staying at Neried's flat enough. :)
->Great location.  Access to reliable public transportation at your doorstep.  Close to good restaurants and famous attractions.
->Perfect host (flexible, very responsive) and Nice location (bus stop right in front of the flat building, walking distance to parks and museums, nice neighborhood)!
->Neried is a wonderful human being and an excellent hostess. Not only was her prior communication superb, but she is also a kind, considerate and respectful hostess. It was particularly appreciated that she made an extra effort to ensure that one felt at ease and private, not only with the use of the room, but more broadly within her home.  Further, there was a cleaning lady who made sure that the room was clean, and this was a thoughtful and appreciated extra touch. Will definitely book her place again in the future🙏🏽🙏🏽<br/>Thank you Neried!

->I had to stay in London for a few days because of the UK train strikes, and I really enjoyed both the room with a sunny terrace to the west on the second floor, and the Holland Park area. I could telework well at the desk during the day (internet 3x faster than where I live), and sleep well during the night. Thank you Katrina for your hospitality.
->A fantastic stay! Katrina was communicative, kind and the space was very comfortable and clean. We thoroughly enjoyed staying here - the location was perfect, and Katrina was a most welcoming host. Our use of both the shared facilities and the bedroom went without a hitch. Katrina made for great conversation also! Thank you Katrina!

->She was so sweet, and flexible as well. There’s a beautiful view on a private terrace and she makes really good homemade marmalade. Everything was really comfortable for the price and it a was very close walk to the tube station.
->Katrina must be the most welcoming and thoughtful host I have ever had! She was so considerate and helpful, my sister and I felt like winning the Airbnb lottery :) Katrina‘s home is lovely, the terrace was great for yoga in the mornings and long chats in the evening, the walk to the tube and bus station is super short and Notting Hill (recommendation: Farm Girl Café) is just a short and utterly beautiful walk through the most beautiful Notting Hill streets away. Definitely recommend staying with Katrina!
->Wonderful spot in a quiet neighborhood. Katrina was very welcoming and accommodating!
->Katrina was erg vriendelijk! We voelde ons erg op ons gemak in haar huis. Ze gaf goede tips over waar je kon eten/drinken. Bij iedere probleem had ze een oplossing klaar. Een nette/schone badkamer en slaapkamer. Mochten we weer naar London komen zullen we zeker nog een keer bij Kartina willen verblijven!
->Katrina's place is a peaceful oasis from the rest of the city, I loved coming back here after a day out and about or at work. Katrina has been very accommodating with my unique situation and this room was exactly what I was looking for! She is very friendly and kind and has become a friend. Her cat, Dolly was also a very friendly and cute addition to my stay! I will be staying here again :)
->Katrina 는 저의 스케줄에 잘 맞춰주었고 <br/>집의 7분 거리에 지하철 역이 있고 <br/>주변에 마트가 있어서 편리 했습니다 <br/>포토벨로마켓과도 가까워 구경하기 좋았습니다
->Another great stay at Katrina's place! I felt very safe (something that is important to me) and comfortable during my week here. This will my go-to place when I need somewhere to stay in London! Thanks again Katrina :)

->The place was fantastic , walkable to tube station , great hospitality by Katherine, cozy room , spacious house .. Would revisit again and happily recommend to family and friends.
->Our stay at Katherine place was a great pleasure. Such a lovely person who took really good care of us. Her place is just amazing. Such a great style, Cousy, clean and with a great character. We loved it the second we saw it from the outside! Thank you Katherine for being so nice, worrying about us arriving late and that we are save! We surely are coming back:)

Thank you, Katherine.
->Katherine has a beautiful place, spacious and a bath tub. She welcomed us with open arms and we were greeted warmly. The bed was comfortable, even for a tall person, the breakfast was a nice touch to the stay. I would definitely recommend Katherine and her place, I will choose her next time I am in London! 
->Staying with Katherine absolutely made our experience in London extraordinary. First of all she graciously awaited us for our 12:30 AM arrival. Her home was everything it appeared to be on the website and much more. The classy decor,  comfortable bed, and robes made us feel so at home. Katherine invited us to help ourselves to tea, coffee, bread and jam, and fruit morning and night. She also warmly gave us suggestions for dining and feedback on our plans which was very helpful. She truly felt like a friend. In terms of location, ideal! Her home is located on a quiet street, a 10 minute walk from Victoria Station and a 2 minute walk from Pimlico Station. Katherine's home is a few blocks walk to many wonderful restaurants, and walking distance to Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, St. James Park, and much more. We can only say staying at Katherine's elevates your experience of London!<br/>
->Katherine's place was beautiful, clean, and cozy, and she was flexible and very welcoming. Breakfast and coffee were lovely and the location was great. Better than a hotel-- I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!

It's walking distance from many of the popular sights like Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, Parliament, and Westminster Abbey.  I had an excellent stay with Katherine and would recommend that anyone visiting London, especially if you're traveling alone, consider staying with her!  :)
->My colleagues where very happy with their stay at Katherines, she made her beautiful home available and made them feel very welcome.<br/>Thank you Katherine, I´ve bookmarked your place for future visits.

->Great location, great hosts and very clean bathroom and bedroom
->My stay at Veeda and Adnan’s was wonderful. They made me feel really at home in their beautiful house.<br/>From the outset, communication with Veeda was very quick and helpful in arranging my stay.<br/>The room was very nice, as was the bathroom and roof terrace, and everything was extremely clean - just what you’d want. Veeda also provided great amenities like a kettle, towels etc, to make the stay even easier.<br/>The area is also perfect for a stay in London: the transport links into the centre are great, yet the area also allows for a more peaceful and relaxed stay in the city in a lovely ‘green’ area near the river.<br/>I would highly recommend this is a place stay and I can’t thank Veeda enough for all her help.
->fabulous hosts, clean and comfortable room and lovely conversations! Very secure. The hosts take the extra step to make you feel like family.
->If I could give Veeda’s accommodation more than 5 stars, I would! Her home is located in a great area of London, and is within a convenient distance of a lot of great sites! The house is beautiful, and my room felt like a 5 star hotel. Veeda and her family were so kind and accommodating of any of my needs and really made me feel welcome in their home. I had a wonderful stay and it was a really great way to end my time in London. I would definitely come back to stay here next time I’m in the city!
->Ths is a 5+ rating. Veeda and her husband are very nice and caring, which makes their lovely home a great stay. They made me felt homey as well.  The location is also a great plus, nice neighborhood and convenient for everything.
->Veeda and her husbound is very nice and friendly hosts, the room and bathroom is clean and the room is bright and cosy. Walkable distances to Victoria station and Sloane square and the house is located in a very nice area.
->Veeda is delightful, charming, welcoming, helpful and easy to communicate with.  Home is located in one of the prettiest pockets of Chelsea, beautifully decorated, with a sense of comfort and warmth. My room was light and well appointed where I immediately felt comfortable and safe.  Wonderful find and definitely super hosts!
->Veeda and her family are wonderful hosts! The checkin process was smooth with great communication (even when my original flight was cancelled and I was put last-minute on an earlier flight, which got me to London several hours earlier than expected!). The bedroom and bathrooms are very clean. The shower is downstairs from the bedroom, but this was not an issue for me, and the toilet is only just down the hall from the bedroom. The bed was warm and comfortable, and big windows provided a beautiful view of the quiet neighborhood (but the shades are easy to close to make the room dark at night). The neighborhood itself felt very safe; even walking around at midnight I felt completely safe by myself. It is less than a 10 minute walk to the nearest tube station, and about 5 minutes to the nearest Starbucks :)  The closest tube station with a direct line to Heathrow is about a 20 minute walk, so if you have a lot of luggage, maybe treat yourself to a black cab or an Uber so you don't have to lug a lot of luggage around the city sidewalks. Veeda had a lot of suggestions of places to eat/things to do, that might not be on the regular tourist lists. I am looking forward to returning again very soon!
->Lovely light, airy room with a really comfy bed in a quiet location but close to the heart of Chelsea.  Veeda was very kind and helpful and really made me feel at home.
->My stay with Veeda and her family was wonderful. She was  accommodating of an early arrival, and was very gracious in letting me do a quick load of laundry in a pinch. Room was very peaceful and cozy, and the location can’t be beat - very central, safe, and close to Battersea and other parks for morning runs or walks, and high street for coffee and other odds and ends.

->Katherine made us feel at home. Although the room is small and access to the bed is only from one side it is very cosy.  <br/>The shower is great and the tube 5 minutes walk away.<br/>If you come from Gatwick it is an ideal place to stay.<br/>We enjoyed the our stay in this nice quiet neighbourhood.<br/>Unfortunately we did not have time to try the pub and indian restaurant across the street.

The place also has everything you need from cooking appliances to ample bedroom space. Ideal for someone wanting a room to experience london or base yourself before finding something permanent. It's also conveniently located close to Ladbroke Grove Station as well as only a short walk to Portobello road.

Tienen un hermoso Gato muy amigable pienso que se debe tener esto en cuenta si son alérgicos.

Esta cerca de Victoria Station y a la vuelta pasan varios transportes públicos para recorrer Londres.

Appartement bien placé dans un quartier calme et riche, à deux pas du métro High street Kennsington.
->This was my very first Airbnb stay.  I chose well!  It was in a lovely spot right off the High Street Kensington Tube stop.  Steven & Natalie were fabulous hosts. They were very patient with my many communications as my arrival was potentially different than my son's.  Their place is lovely, modern, serene  and the shared facilities were never a problem.  <br/>It was in an charming square, with a lovely neighborhood feel right in the prime of London.  We were on the go & only there 3 nights ~ wish it could have been longer.  Steven helped me out when my converter did not work, and they were gracious to my friend who arrived earlier than we did for our night out.  Would love to return someday soon!   Thank you again.

->This place is situated pretty close to Maida Vale tube station. Despite their busy lifestyles, the hosts were happy to have a quick chat when at home.<br/>The place is pretty quiet and will suit anyone who is independent.<br/>Some of the photos shown can be updated and the wifi should be sorted by now.
->While I didn't get to meet Carolin - she substituted her charming sister instead - everything went easily regarding finding the place and "checking in".<br/>The property was in a lovely quiet residential district and the bedroom very comfortable.
->Ich war mehr als zufrieden mit dieser Unterkunft. Ein sehr schönes Zimmer, gutes Bett, tolles Bad und alles blitzsauber. Dazu eine sehr nette, aufmerksame Gastgeberin. Die Lage ist wunderschön, ruhig und dennoch schnell an der U-Bahn und in der Stadt, schönste viktorianische Häuser und gleich der Park gegenüber, ein wunderbarer Aufenthalt!
->Carolin and her flatemate were very nice. The bed was very comfortable. Close to the underground. Everything was perfect.
->He disfrutado de la habitación de Carolin estos días y me ha resultado muy acogedora. Carolin se ha encargado que estuviese lo mas cómoda posible, ya que ella estaba de viaje. Su compañera ha sido una excelente anfitriona. <br/>La casa se encuentra en un barrio residencial a unos minutos del metro.<br/>Londres no es barato, por lo que la relación calidad precio está bien.

REVIEWS:

->A great place to stay if you’re travelling on a budget. All as expected, with helpful and clear communication from the host. Way more private, secure and convenient than hostels at similar price points! Would recommend!
->Really enjoyed my stay here. It's a basement flat, with no windows, so I was a little unsure at first. But the air filtration system made the flat very comfortable, and with no outside light or street sounds, I had the best sleep EVER!  <br/>The flat is located right in the heart of Bayswater, across the street from two Tubes, two minutes from Kensington Gardens. The road is well-served by markets and eateries and pubs. <br/>Bear in mind, there is a microwave, but no fridge. The flat was very clean and warm, the bed was comfortable, the Wifi worked well, etc. Sohail is a nice host and very nearby. For the price and the location, this place is really a great deal.  I'd stay here again.
->I love the location! The 3 minute walk to Kensington Garden/ Hyde Park made my stay so relaxed. It was the perfect way to start or end the day. Conveniently right next to the apartment are two metro stations as well as two supermarkets which also made life super easy. And Sohail was a great host.
->Nice flat for a short stay in London. Just 30sec to go to the subway "Bayswater".  Grocery stores even close to the flat.
->Nice, quiet little basement flat, great location, easy check in, good value. Can't fault it.
->Fantastic amount of space for the money, separate bedroom, shower, toilet and kitchen for the same price as a hostel. Check in was collecting the key from shop above, I was running a bit late but got a swift reply. Was mainly using as a base after a gig overnight and only five mins from Queensway station. Was a busy high street at night but was quiet and secure downstairs. Bedroom could have fitted a double bed without the wardrobe. <br/>Was a bit noisy with fan/ventilation systems from above and in the morning with business adjacent to the accommodation banging and talking. Also the floors/surfaces etc weren't cleaned too well but on balance I'd happily stay again.
->Great place- just a minute from the Bayswater station…clean and cozy…will definitely recommend.
->value for money
->Excellent location near transportation and parks.
->Ideal for a single traveller, fantastic transport links, Bayswater station is 30 secs away with connections to the circle & district lines.<br/>Hyde park is a minute away.<br/>Check in info is clear & Sohail has great communication & msg response.<br/>Great value for money, the only thing that lets it down is cleanliness, the toilets & shower area need a thorough deep clean.
