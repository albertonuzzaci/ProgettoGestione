REVIEWS:

->Cemile is very sweet and easy to get on with! She definitely goes out of her way to make sure you're having a comfortable stay. The location is perfect for tourists looking to go around London. And it's also close to the underground and bus station. I would stay here again.
->Cemile is a very sincere girl with a very personal character, the house is very warm and cosy. And the dog is also very cute. The house is very suitable for people who travel to London.
->everything was really good!
->Cemile is a great host who is very respectful to your stay in the shared property. Louie the dog made my stay much more welcoming by coming to say hello to me each day! The location of the flat is in perfect walking distance of all public transport links and is easy to find. <br/>The price was fantastic for my week stay, especially for London! <br/>The only downside was lack of freezer space so I was limited when it came to preparing and keeping food. <br/>Thanks again Cemile
->Cosy and clean.
->Lovely bedroom space. Gets a wee bit hot on hot summer nights, but not too bad. Host is a lovely, good-hearted lady with a very sweet doggie.
->Kind host, cute dog, great location, nice energy.<br/>P.s. don't fear the foxes. They are easy-going and mind their own business.
->Nice space and in a great location. There's a Tesco nearby and another food shop just below the flat...it was quiet, and warm and overall cozy and welcoming. The room is pretty big and perfect for 2 people. Cemille is a great host, very nice and welcoming, she made me a cup of tea when she came home, and made sure we had everything we needed.
->Great location <br/>Cemile is a very friendly host <br/>Easy to get along and easy to talk to <br/>Love her dog Louie too!
->This is such a great location to visit central London. It's a 15 - 20 minute walk to the underground and rail services. Very comfortable accommodation. Great neighborhood. Jem (spelling?) is wonderful and her dog, Louis, is a sweetie.

  name: Bright double room in relaxed family home with dog
  description: We are offering a bright and comfortable double spare bedroom in a 1970s town house on a well designed estate in Nunhead. Modernist in feel. I have a ten year old son Morgan and a large labradoodle dog Albie.  We are looking to rent to someone who is ok with children and a very friendly if slightly exciteable dog. The room looks over a quiet tree lined road, hence Limes walk.<br />The house has lots of light with skylights and sliding doors the full width of the house onto a balcony.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />You would be sharing the bathroom and kitchen with us.<br />There is a library of books in the room which you would be welcome to use.
REVIEWS:

->Expect to have a peaceful and great place to stay. Hatty and Morgan are super friendly and I felt like being home. I was quite busy so not around too much but in the evening it was great to come back here and have a chat with Hatty and then go to bed.
->I spent a quite good time in Hatty’s home, the dog is very outgoing also Hatty and Morgan are friendly and welcome. The journey is busy because we went to the firework so we come back very late, I hope we were not disturbing you. The house is cozy and beautiful also the transport is very convenient. Extremely recommend for all you guys who visit London.
->I stayed at Hatty’s for nearly two weeks between a move. The house is a great space - very stylish and arty. The bedroom is sizeable and has a fridge and a kettle included. There is an absolutely giant bath which was an added bonus!<br/>Potential lodgers should bear in mind that this is a proper family home with a relaxed vibe. The room is next door to Hatty’s son and you will be escorted up and down the stairs by a very lovable dog. <br/>Hatty went above and beyond for me during my stay so I consider her hosting to be exceptional.
->Hatty has a great artsy vibe house in beautiful Nunhead. I booked her room for a 2-week stay for my mother who was visiting family in the area. Despite my mom not speaking any English, she felt comfy in Hatty's place. Big raving reviews for the dog as well! Despite never meeting Hatty in person, I had a great interaction with her online. I would happily use her place again in the future.
->Hatty's place is really nice and homely, with a friendly dog Albi who loves to hang out with you and follows you around from time to time. Room was bright and spacious, fast internet and comes with a desk. Really useful since I work from my laptop during the day. I spent a great week there. Would definitely stay there again when I come back to London.
->Hatty’s family is super friendly. I had great conversations with her talking about arts and politics. Morgan is a quiet and polite boy and Albie the dog is very welcoming.<br/>There’re many modern artworks throughout the flat. The bedroom has a relaxing view and lots of books to read, all are of good taste. The bed is comfortable and clear, every morning I woke up feeling refreshed.<br/>Prefect for who likes a home-like vibe, and wants some very local tips.
->Everything was as expected.  Thanks a lot Hatty.
->Funky townhouse in quiet area of Nunhead. Bright, airy room with comfortable bed. Parking right outside, which I liked. Dog will proudly present you with a shoe, so pretend to be impressed to avoid hurting his feelings. Would definitely stay again. Recommended.
->Hatty's double bedroom is a perfect sized room with everything you could ever need. Hatty and Morgan were so welcoming and they have a lovely dog Albie, who has lots of energy and is very friendly. There is loads of amazing art around the house and she has a great sized kitchen/living room area that you can easily spend time in relaxing. Overall one of the best stays I have ever had and would happily stay again!
->I enjoyed my stay at Hattys home, she responds very quick. Hatty was very helpful. Her son and dog very respectful. I enjoyed my stay.

Also good storage space in the bedroom. <br/>I look forward to staying with them again when I'm in the area!
->Thank you Amanda and Chef Steve for a most heart welcoming and enjoyable stay at their home. What a wonderful experience: warm comfortable home, I felt like I was at home away from home, excellent value for money, and wait for it - the most beautiful garden that lights up at night. The bad ..... No fault of their own - Just couldn't extend my stay for a third time due to being fully booked till August!  No wonder why......
->Amanda and Stephen were warm, helpful hosts and the household, just as described, was relaxed and friendly.  The neighbourhood was quiet, pleasant and convenient.  I would definitely stay again.

The Southfields tube station is really close and there are also some shops and nice places to eat at the station. The dogs were really cute, especially little Napoleon! If I need a place to stay again in London Amanda's and Stephen's place would be my first choice. Thank you so very much!

One window had no blind or curtain. The bathroom was shared but there was a separate toilet. We did not sample breakfast. Checkout time is a generous 12 noon.

->Manda es una increíble anfitriona, tiene todo organizado a la perfección para que tu estancia sea lo más cómoda posible, como en tu propia casa. Muchísimas gracias por todo Manda. Recomendable 100%.
->Manda was a very nice and friendly host and has a lovely quiet room on top of her house. She welcomed us with some tea when we arrived and gave us a guide with instructions of the facilities in the room, of how to get to the center of London and some other advice. We would definitely recommend staying here even though the trip to the center of the city is a bit long, as you have to catch the train and later the underground.
->Esperienza positivissima. <br/>Stanza carinissima! <br/>Letto comodissimo! <br/>Tutto pulito e ordinato! <br/>Manda gentilissima! <br/>Io mi sono trovata davvero bene e lo consiglio. <br/>Sono stata una settimana. <br/>La zona è ben collegata e la via principale con i locali e i supermercati è a pochi minuti di distanza a piedi ma passa anche l'autobus. <br/>La fermata è proprio all'angolo. <br/>I due gatti sono carinissimi e discreti: mi hanno dato il benvenuto quando sono arrivata. 
->Everything was exactly as in the picture, the room is clean and spacious and the house is well connected to the city centre.<br/>Manda is a perfect host, she provided all the information we needed before the arrival and as we arrived, she explained us everything and provided a guide book which was very helpful.<br/><br/>The house is located in a nice zone, quite and very "English". It's not very close to the centre, but the transports are super efficient (even till late!) and we never had any problem with this.<br/>There are several supermarkets, restaurants ans shops.<br/><br/>Definetly recommended<br/>
->Vše bylo podle očekávání<br/>Spokojenost 
->Lovely comfortable room with bathroom en suite- the bed was so comfortable and the area was very quiet. My hostess was very friendly and welcoming. Would stay again on my next visit to London.
->Manda was an excellent host. Communication was great and she was accommodating enough to allow flexibility over the collection of the keys,  which helped us greatly.

REVIEWS:

->This was fantastic accommodation in a great location with a super friendly host. I stayed ahead of a work event and found the whole process from check-in to check-out absolutely seamless. Roisin, the host, was super responsive and the room itself was comfortable and the perfect size for me and easily one other. South Wimbledon tube is a short walk away and the house itself is full of character and situated in a lovely spot. Would definitely stay again if the need arises.
->Roisin’s place was amazing, she’s an amazing host, very helpful and super friendly. It’s very easy to get around from her place, shops and public transports are very close by, I would recommend this place to anybody travelling to London, we definitely had a good time with her.
->Beutiful place with kind host, cool cat<br/>Was really clean and quiet
->Roisin is a very nice  and gentle lady, very friendly and easy-going. Her house is very clean and cozy, and there is a big supermarket and a bus stop nearby, very convenient, and she has a very cute cat named Scrabby, I love it! Highly recommended! I will miss her and her Scrabby!
->Una casa preciosa en una zona muy bonita y tranquila.<br/>Roisin súper amable, muy agradable y simpática, detalles de platos y cubiertos que me han encantado.<br/>Preocupada por si tenía frío y cosas parecidas, que se agradece muchísimo.<br/>Una muy buena opción para estar en Londres.
->Roisin is such a gorgeous host ! We've spent a wonderful week in London in Roisin's house, near from Tube, restaurants and pubs ! The house is really clean and peaceful, and Roisin gave us a lot of advices and informations about visiting London ! <br/>If you go to Roisin, you'll meet Scrabby too, a cute and wonderful ginger cat 😍<br/>If you like quiet places, sharing with people and cat, Roisin's house is made for you ! <br/>Thanks a lot for this week !!
->I had travelled for a course up in Wimbledon and it was certainly home away from home. <br/>From the moment one crosses the threshold into Roisin’s house, it is as one is part of the family. Neat and clean house, with the luxury of having the opportunity to use the kitchen to make ones own meals and space in the house to relax thereafter which is an extra bonus. <br/>Shops are a 5 minute walk away with a 24hour Bus service (57) going into London and a 10 minute ride by bus into Wimbledon Town Centre. Very very awesome!! <br/>Would definitely recommend the place to all.
->Roisin’s place is fantastic. She truly makes you feel at home and is a lovely person to talk to. All the amenities are in working order and the location is great, just around the corner from sainsburys and aldi. Scrabby her cat is super kind and loves a pat, he’s a great asset. I can’t recommend Roisin’s place more!
->My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Roisin. Her house is lovely and has all the amenities you could possibly need. The hosts, Roisin and Scrabby were very welcoming and made us feel at home and we would love to stay there again if we have the chance. Would definitely recommend!
->My stay with Roisin was perfect. She is super friendly and very easy to get along with! The house was lovely and was a home away from home for me. Stayed for 3 weeks while settling into a new job and was a fantastic base. Couldn’t recommend enough. Oh and Scrabby the cat is brilliant company :) suitable for short and long stays

->I thoroughly enjoyed my short stay.  Lida is a very kind and helpful host and made me very welcome. She asked me if I needed directions and welcomed me with a cup of coffee and snack. The converted loft is spacious, clean and comfortable with all amenities needed like TV,, WI-FI, fridge, kettle and the bathroom on the same floor so really like a studio. Good location, walkable from Romford train station with the new Elizabeth like providing a speedy connection to central London. Highly recommended!.
->Really great location, easy access to transport and shops, easy walking distance to Hornchurch, the room was perfect and cosy, at the top of the house with your own bathroom, perfect, what more could you want! Lida is also a fantastic host and really made my stay extra special, a big warm thank you to Lida, Iraj and Milo. Highly recommended.
->Quiet place. Welcoming hosts. Highly recommended !!
->Lida is a lovely host. She cares about her guests and is very with tips. <br/>I stayed for four days and felt very comfortable throughout the time of my stay. <br/>Excellent value for money.

->Lovely hosts and a very nice room at the top of the house. Private - like a little studio, with bathroom and lovely character. Lida and her husband are excellent hosts. Thanks for having me to stay. All the best, Ray
->Lida is such a helpful and great host. She responded promptly and was able to accommodate me for a last-minute booking. Her house is very clean; so is the loft room, which has a lot of space. Lida provided everything needed, including cold water and milk in the fridge in the loft room. The house is within walking distance to the metro station on the Elizabeth line.
->Hosts very nice and welcoming but cleanliness on the property is in a mediocre state. basic neceities are replaced to "traditional ones". Only for one night and I don't want to go back again💚<br/>Host does not give access key to the main door and rooms have no lock. privacy ? where ?
->Lida and her husband are lovely hosts. They were really understanding of me arriving late 2 evenings in a row due to my commitments. The bedroom and adjoining bathroom are very nice and feel very private. I will stay again!

->We spent a lovely journey in London thanks to Tsengel and her family! <br/>The house was clean, warm, friendly. We enjoyed being there and we would have loved to stay there for two months ! There is a bus station: less than 15 minutes walk to get in the center of London in less than 30 minutes. There are shops around. <br/>We just loved being in a family, in particular in this family which was so adorable to us. 🥰 We will be back soon!! <br/>Thank you for everything! <br/>We had our own bedroom with a long desk,  2 chairs, a wardrobe and a big piece of furniture to stock our things. There was even space to put my mat to do my sport routine haha! <br/>We had many surprises as we’ve been offered more hangers, new slippers, a fridge! So we had our own fridge in our room and as we were close to Easter 🐣 we got chocolate from Tsengel that was just so sweet! <br/>Tsengel was always ready to help us and to make ourselves at home! <br/>The bathroom was ours and we could of course use the kitchen and living room. The kitchen is fully furnished! Microwave, oven, hotplates, etc. <br/>The house is luminous and we loved to hear the children laugh, play together, sing, play piano etc. It was just pure joy and we felt safe (because we had a bad experience in an other airbnb when we first arrived in London). <br/>As my boyfriend and I are shy, we ate in our bedroom and Tsengel told us multiple times that we could enjoy the living room if we wanted, that was very nice! <br/>Pickles is the sweetest dog 🐕 so funny and loving we loved cuddling him! As an anxious person, it is so good to have a pet around !! 🥰 <br/>It’s a long review but it’s only positive!! Thank you so much 🌞<br/>If you want to come in France, you are welcome! 🇫🇷
->We had a lovely time. Tsengel was just amazing. Always ready to help and super available. The house is also lovely. Thanks a lot!!!
->Very friendly and accommodating reception;  although we booked one room at modest cost, we were given the run of the family house, and were guarded by their friendly Labrador.
->The bedroom has a comfortable bed, TV, mini fridge, desk, drawers and a place to hang up your clothes. You have easy access to your room, close to the front door and the bathroom is right across the hall. <br/>Tsengel most generously invited us into her family space and we enjoyed interacting with her three children and sweet dog, Pickles. She had other guests upstairs which was also nice to interact with while eating or cooking a meal. <br/>Tsengel is a considerate, kind and helpful person; we are so happy we stayed with her family.
->Tsengel was a lovely host, very helpful and communicative . 100% recommend
->Tsengel and her family were really nice and welcoming! I felt very comfortable during my stay, would highly recommend!
->A great stay with Tsengel, her family and the lovely Pickle. Everyone made me feel really welcome into their home. Room was great and totally as described, really well equipped and a comfy bed. A Greta stay and I would highly recommend.
->Very tidy and lovely Airbnb equipped with everything you need. The house is clean and comfortable. Tsengel is so friendly and accommodating.
->La zona es muy bonita, distante de los terminales de bus. <br/>La casa es muy cómoda y acogedora. <br/>El servicio de cocina y servicios fueron los ofrecidos. <br/>La anfitriona fue muy gentil. Nos dio facilidades para el checkin y nos brindó hospitalidad. <br/>Tienen en casa un perro encantador. Si te gustan los perros disfrutarás el lugar. <br/>Estamos muy complacidos.
->Amazing stay! Very comfortable and well equipped. Tsengel welcomed us warmly and helped us a lot. Really enjoyed having chats with Tsengel. Feels just like home! Highly recommended.

REVIEWS:

->Very friendly household!
->It's a good basic room: bare walls but a double bed, a desk and a closet for your use. View of the harden. A hundred-year-old house with original wood floors and 1960s retro styling of accessories: it was nice and relaxed, like living with roommates as a Londoner.  Emma and I chatted in the evenings over a glass of wine listening to her LPs.<br/>Quite to the east of the central part of London, so commuting in took about 45 minutes. the neighborhood is neat, though, and worth it - yummy South Indian restaurants open late and a few all night fruit stands. Very diverse, with African, Polish, Indian, and young artsy English folks all around. It's a bit of a walk to the Underground.<br/>For the price of a dorm in a hostel, you get a whole room and use of living room and kitchen in a groovy immigrant neighborhood and a friendly host.
->Lovely little home, short walk from the station and easy to get to! Emma was so lovely organising everything and check-in was super easy!
->Nice great and clean room. Emma is welcoming answers all the questions very quickly does everything to arrange you.
->Very nice and clean place to stay. Lovely neighbourhood. Very close to public transport. Great host. Cannot say anything bad at all. Thanks Emma Jane!
->Great place for those who want to stay in London for a couple of days. The room is spacious and clean, the house in general is very nice and Emma Jane is a great host!
->Cool place, comfortable room. Laid back atmosphere
->Good considering the price.<br/>Thanks for your availability!
->Easy to find and near public transport. Host helpful and friendly. Bonus is the lovely black cat who will join you for cuddles 💜
->The location is good in Zone 3 and the area has a great selection of shops to buy food and drink.  I enjoyed my stay very much.
