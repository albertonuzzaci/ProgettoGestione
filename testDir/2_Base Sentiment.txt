I'm a student looking for a budget-friendly hostel in Kensington or Westminster. I don't care about having all kind of amenities.

  name: St. John's Wood large private room
  description: Near Baker Street, Abbey Road, Lord's Cricket grounds, Regent's Park & Primrose Hill (circa 1.5kms), 1 minute walk (100 metres) from Maida Vale tube stations (Bakerloo line to Oxford Circus in 12 mins), 10 minute walk from St. John's Wood station (Jubilee line). You can walk to Oxford Street in circa 45 mins. Split level apartment, large private room, bathroom with shower/bath & sink and separate bathroom with sink/toilet. Large kitchen.
REVIEWS:

->Pros of this apartment is that its in a great location a couple minutes from the tube and the room is everything you can ask for in terms of cleanliness and comfort.<br/>Cons are that host asked for additional payment after we had made the booking for two people and removed the car parking amenity. Attempts to fix this were notably unpleasant and this soured the beginning of the stay significantly. Airbnb support however were very helpful and did give us a partial refund for the trip.
->great location very close to tube

In addition there is a sofa-bed in the shared living room.<br /><br />Guests are welcome to use the kitchen facilities at their leisure.
REVIEWS:

->The apartment was OK. Very good location in south Kensington, 5 bus stops from the closest Tube station (South Kensington). The bed is not very comfy, it is old and unstable but I think it could be ok a short stay. Richard is a good host but he wasnt reachable all the time. I've used Airb&b many times before and hosts tend to always be very reachable at any time and mostly in case of an emergency which was our case. The  front door key didn't work and we had to find a place to stay at 2am which was very unfortunate. I have to say though that this was an exceptional situation and I'm sure this won't be the case in future with other people staying here. I still think this is good VFM if you have to spend a few nights in London and you don't want to pay expensive hotels. But make sure the keys work before leaving the place ;)

->conforme aux photos , proche du centre,  bus et métro à qques pas , quartier résidentiel,  confortable, nous recommandons fortement cet appartement
->A good sized apartment with 2 good sized bedrooms ( one is en suite ) it also has a good sized kitchen and living area, with patio doors opening on to an outside seating area.  There was a shop / off licence a few minutes walk away.
->Thank you for all the Team White Rabbit,<br/>It was a pleasure !<br/>The flat is perfect and really spacious<br/>See you soon,<br/>Mathews
->Very roomy, comfortable flat. Very nice stay!
->This flat is tucked away about 5-10min walk from the nearest Underground. The neighborhood was decent and there wasn’t a lot of outside noise, however, you could see shadows of people walking by at night from one of the bedrooms, but not a big deal. <br/>This was our fourth trip to London, we visited in January (with my friend, my wife, and our infant son.) The heat in one of the bedrooms was broken, which was unfortunate since we had our infant son with us. They provided a small space heater but that wasn’t working well either. <br/>The beds were comfortable, there was hot water, although the shower pressure wasn’t great, the bathrooms were otherwise nice. The layout was especially convenient since we put our son to bed early and were able to be in the common area with two doors separating us so as not to wake him. WiFi was ok, not great but strong  enough for our baby monitor to work. The table looks a bit different than it does in the photo, holes on the surface now. <br/>There is a washer and a drying rack which works decently. The tv has Netflix and the common area was spacious enough for the four of us in there without feeling too crowded. <br/>Location was ok, not too close but not too far away from the main attractions, but will require a fair amount of walking. Easy enough to get around with a collapsible travel stroller. There is a small Sainsbury’s nearby which was convenient. Overall a nice stay.
->A spacious apartment, with brand new pots and pans, some basics, such as salt, sugar, oil, tea, coffee, etc.  That comes in very handy. Several grocery  shops around, good wifi connection, plenty of storage space. The bathrooms, however, have only overhead shower and no hose, it makes quite impossible taking a shower without making your hair wet. Very uncomfortable when it comes to bathing a small child. Otherwise, a great place to stay!
->Korrekt ház, korrekt helyen, felszerelve minden szükséges eszközzel és használati tárggyal.
->The apartment was very spacious and bright so the stay was comfortable. it's located between two tube stations so it allows a lot of flexibility when lines are closed for maintenance (which happened to us during our stay), but it's about 10 to 12 minutes walk to each station, so with our luggages it was bit of hassle. but overall it was a comfortable stay.
->Lage und Quartier ruhig, schöne und grosse Wohnung, Tisch und Stühle sollten ersetzt werden, sowie alle defekten Küchengeräte
->the house is very nice, but it's 20 minute walking from the tube station. the heating doesn't work properly in all rooms.

REVIEWS:

->Neat apartment with a mezzanine bed space . Note: low headroom in this area.<br/>All facilities to hand although a bit short on cooking utensils but I managed to use the oven, grill and one pan to cook four proper evenin meals for one and poached eggs on toast for breakfast. <br/>I was a bit nervous as this was my first experience with Air B & B rather than hotels, and when I saw the cigarette ends on the sunny (shared) balcony I was worried I'd be 'smoked out', but thankfully nobody smoked during my stay.  I was really pleased at how quiet it was - i guess residents are more conscious of their neighbours' ears than the average hotel guest.  Samantha was great to deal with.<br/>(I can understand why the previous booker's booking was cancelled going by their risque photo.  I would've done the same...)
->Apartment is situated in great location, quiet and clean neighborhood with great connection to many London attractions. Apartment itself is clean and cosy, perfect for single and couple. <br/>Samantha was very helpful with direction and quick response. Unfortunately we didn't have time to meet Samantha personally but if plan our next trip to London we will text her.

REVIEWS:

->Joe's flat was much more spacious than expected from the photos. That, however, was largely due to its being very sparsely furnished. The little storage space there was was mainly occupied by the host's possessions. <br/>Upon arrival, I found the place comparatively clean but far from sparkling. <br/>I never got to meet Joe, who was abroad during my stay, but he was usually quick and very easy to communicate with. He made sure to send me exact instructions as to where to pick up the keys on arrival two days before, although that being organised through a nearby deli inevitably led to some unnecessary confusion and frustration. (the person responsible was not at the place at the moment, and the other staff knew nothing about the situation. We did figure it out in the end but only after a very scary hour of uncertainty waiting outside in the rain with my suitcases. It also could have been helpful to know in advance of the key's tendency to jam)<br/><br/>The flat's locations very convenient for public transportation, with buses to the main attractions in most directions literally outside the door. Notting Hill Gate is about 10-15 minutes away by foot.

->Nice landlord, good communication
->I have stayed before with no issues, so I did 2 bookings over the next weeks. On my way to the property I realised the host forgot to send the checkin instructions. From 6pm to 11pm both me and Airbnb tried to contract the host and it’s management company Resify through all means available. No communication. Airbnb cancelled the booking and I had to find a last minute stay. Apparently to the host it only showed as 1 booking and that’s why they did not send me the checkin instructions. Possibly understandable, but the lack of communication is not, not even the emergency contact numbers of the host or the management company Resify worked. This could be really dangerous. I nearly was homeless that night, someone else could lose their keys and have no way to contact the host. I hope this review brings light to this issue and I understand host can’t be available 24/7 but consider switching management services.
->Good room but lack common area and dining table , also not the best area to live in
->ik heb een mooie bed op geslapen
->good
->The apartment itself had all the necessary amenities needed. However, please take note the bedroom window doesn’t open, so no fresh air and health & safety hazard. Secondly, this is not in Notting Hill. The street is very unsafe and was followed to the apartment and verbally harassed on multiple occasions in broad daylight.

REVIEWS:

->Fantastic cozy apartment in the perfect location. Situated in a picturesque location, this apartment is the perfect base from which the rest of London can be explored. It is just a short walk to buses on Kings road and to Sloane Square or South Kensington tube stations.
->Good location, 7 minutes walk to the nearest tube station.<br/>No air-conditioning, had to sleep with open windows, on a main road , quite noisy.<br/>Clean and we'll equipped kitchen and bathroom.
->房东Ruth非常热心，给予了我们很多耐心的帮助，在此请允许我用中文介绍。这个房子空间足够大，拥有干净的卫生间和厨房，就像图片描述的一样。此外房子的位置非常好，距离South Kinsten地铁站步行五分钟左右，到伦敦市的主要景点都非常便利。公寓的对面还有一件小百货超市，早上7点一直营业到晚上12点，可以买到足够的生活用品和各种食物。我非常推荐大家选择这个住处作为探索伦敦的根据地。
->This block is in a brilliant location near Sloane Sq station in Chelsea. Handy to everything. There are a number of apartments I’ve stayed in in this block and they are all different. This one is good value and low cost but also very bare, cheaply decorated, and not terribly comfortable. It could use bedside tables and lamps, a sofa or comfy chairs, some pictures on the walls, rugs etc, just some home comforts to make it homely. Otherwise it’s just a bed - in a room with a big TV on the wall. Disappointing 😭
->Location of the flat is at Nell Gwynn house at SLOAN Avenue which is so convenient.  Easy check in with porters as they have your name. You get there with picadilly line straight from airport with underground and cheap ticket. Close to 3 museums and shaatchi gallery. Between two underground stations (south Kensington and Sloan’ square). The flat for central London is big, with light and clean. Ruth the owner ( we didn’t have the chance to meet her in personal y) tried to answer and fix anything we said to her. She had a difficulty to see our message quick but she replied.<br/>The furniture is below basic!!! The bed was broken. The mattress was sinking is some parts (she told me that she ordered a new one after informing her about it) so we didn’t sleep well the whole week.<br/>The two chairs were almost about to fall apart. No side tables which was so inconvenient. On the other hand kitchen and bathroom were well equipped clean and there where some staff like salt pepper coffee or air freshener ear pads, shampoo etc which were helpful.<br/>I had read at house instructions that we should do the plates washing that we did but it was not meant to take out the garbages as I was told<br/>I had paid for cleaning anyway! So mostly apparently for us , was late checkout as there was no further booking as our flight was late evening that gave us rest and we enjoyed! Thanks Ruth I will be back after you have upgrade furniture which was very disappointing for this nice flat at this building as I have stayed in many of those and this one was under my expectations!
->Ruth’s place was simple and had everything we needed. It had a bus stop right outside and was convenient to get to both south Kensington and sloane square station. If you’d rather walk, it’s about a 10 min walk to either of the stations. Since the apartment faced the main road, at times we could hear people talking in the street or out in the drop off area in the middle of the night. However, that did not affect us and was able to have a good nights rest. I would recommend staying at her place if you’re looking for your own space that is convenient to get to and from the tube stations.
->C'est bien situé, propre et fonctionnel.
->Ruth's place was in a great location and it was clean. However, be aware that you may not get good quality sleep. As the bed, mattress, and pillows were so uncomfortable and clearly very cheap and the apartment was located in a very noisy building; people would talk loudly in the middle of the night. Additionally, the windows weren't closing all the way which made the place cold and even louder as you could also hear street noise.
->Super prime location and great hospitality!<br/>The room itself is minimal but great, well-equipped and super clean!<br/>John and Ruth are great home managers, with super fast responses to any question.<br/>Check in and out is smooth as the complex has porters services 24/7.<br/>Much recommended!
->very clean and  a perfect location in London

REVIEWS:

->Superbe appartement très agréable, un peu loin du centre.
->Un apartamento acogedor muy cerca de Notting Hill!!
->Super appartement je le recommande vivement <br/>Notre hôte fut disponible pour l organisation de notre séjour <br/>Logement moderne propre avec une super deco <br/>Le jardin est un vrai plus <br/>Merci à nos hôtes 
->Great Place for a young Family to explore London.
->Bastante cerca de una estación de metro en menos de media hora estas en el centro. El barrio muy tranquilo.  Y la casa muy limpia e igual que las fotos. 
->Logement très confortable (surtout le lit!), propre et avec une déco très sympathique. Quartier calme le soir et la nuit, pas très loin du centre de Londres (attention, à Londres, on considère que ce n'est pas très loin si c'est à moins d'une heure de transport. Ici, j'ai mis entre 30 et 45 mns suivant l'endroit au centre où j'allais), et très proche de Portobello Market. Je n'ai pas pu rencontrer Felipe mais il a été très réactif aux quelques messages que je lui ai adressés. Une amie à Felipe m'attendait pour me remettre les clés du logement; j'étais un peu embarrassée parce que mon vol avait 2 heures de retard, mais l'accueil a néanmoins été très correct.
->The house is just incredible. We are welcomed with a friendly welcoming message at the door, some adapters (USB entrance) to charge or electronics, a warm environment thanks to the heaters that were always on and the most comfortable bed and sofa bed. Felipe and Karla were always available to answer any doubts or problems we had, it's a shame we didn't get to meet them in person! The house is completely adorable, full of little details that make us feel at home. The undergrounds is 10min walking, Portobello Market is 15min walking, Tesco Express is less then 5min walking, the bus stop is less than 5min walking and Sainsbury is just a short bus ride away. <br/>We loved our time here and we hope to come back soon :)<br/>All the best for you Felipe and Karla!
->Nice stylish place, very comfortable. Plenty of space for two people. Within walking distance of Latimer Road and White City tube stations, so convenient for transport. Quick responses from Felipe when I had questions, and he proactively checked in with me regarding the stay throughout.
->Muy recomendable. He viajado con mi hijo minusválido y la casa ha sido un verdadero hogar.
->After searching for a while we settled down for this one for a mix of location, cost, good reviews and the looks of it and we are very happy with our choice! The house is beautifully decorated, the location is quite good, the hosts are super friendly and helpful and it was an amazing experience overall, I wouldn't change it for anything else :) bonus points for speaking portuguese

REVIEWS:

->I hightly recommand this hotel! A friendly place, well located with a great staff!
->Nice place to crash and meet some interesting travellers.
->Everything was ok
->Astor Kensington is a great Hostel with the nicest persons working there I have seen for a long time. They are incredibly friendly and do everything that you feel comfortable at your stay. The rooms are nothing special but provide all the things one needs and are clean.
->Un extraordinario lugar para quedarse! Limpio,muy buen ubicado, con reglas claras y personal muy ameno! Sin duda, muy recomendable! Ha sido todo un placer!
->Such a great place with very nice people and good atmosphere!
->Una excelente opción para un viaje a Londres dentro de presupuesto. Excelente ubicación, personal muy agradable, mucho respeto y seguridad. Sin duda regresaría.
->위치가 최고에요. 하이드파크근처라 어딜 가든 금방 가고 정말 좋습니다. 다 좋은데...아무래도 호스텔이라 그런 것도 있지만 화장실이 비좁고 가끔 더럽습니다. 저는 12인 혼성 도미토리를 썼는데 혼성이란 것은 감안하세요! 조식은 그냥 시리얼에 빵인데 그렇게 훌륭하진 않습니다 가끔 음....당황스러운 일도 있었지만. 그래도 가격대비 위치가 좋고 무엇보다 호스트분들이 매우 친절하세요.  <br/>정리하자면 퍼펙트한 숙소는 아니지만 잠만 자고 다른 일정 소화하기엔 훌륭하다.
->First time staying in a dorm and enjoyed it. The location is great and public transport is just few minutes away.
->Bring your own soap and shampoo. Having your own slippers would also be very handy as sometimes the toilet floor is quite dirty as people get in with their shoes on. Other than that he place is very strategic. Very close to the kensington palace and hyde park. Less than 20 mins to the city of london

REVIEWS:

->Great location - would recommend.
->great value, clean bed, and sheets, clean toilet. The shared room itself was quite messy and smelled like 10 guys but this was expected. However one person was an incredibly loud snorer, and I'm pretty sure half the room couldn't sleep that night. I also didn't like the fact that they use the press and timed water faucets like in public restrooms (the ones that stop by themselves). The hot and cold taps are separated making it impossible to wash your face at the sink.
->We had an amazing stay, great location, fantastic value for money and staff were all very polite and helpful. Would recommend.
->السكن سعره رخيص بس انت وحظك انا حظي اللي كانو معي في الغرفه بنات وكانو نظيفين وريحه الغرفه عطور ومكاييج
->Bathrooms are rather cramped in size but regardless great stay and friendly people!
->Surprisingly clean 12-bed room & bathroom! Also no loud matrasses or anything. However, 3-story-beds do make some noises when people climb up, but that should be clear and doesn't display a problem. Check-In/Out couldn't be easier!
->everything was nice, would recommend :)
->No tuvimos buena experiencia y nos fuimos. La chica de recepción nos pidió disculpas y nos devolvieron el dinero.
->남녀혼용 12인실도 안전하게 쓰고갑니다. 청결은 살짝 포기하셔야돼요. 화장실도 공용이라 감안하시구요. 하지만 전반적으로 괜찮았습니다. 바로 앞에 하이드파크가 있어서 피크닉하기에 너무 좋아요
->Great stay

REVIEWS:

->Very nice !
->Buen lugar, destacó la limpieza de la cocina.
->Staff was kind and helpful and the hostel was easily accessible from station. There was a lack of outlet chargers within the room and as a remote worker, lack of dedicated quiet working space at the facility. Affordable hostel.
->Muy bien, estaría increíble si agregaran una cortina para tener más privacidad, en general la atención del equipo muy amable, hablan español e ingles y además puedes dejar tu equipaje antes de tu check in y lo guardan, muy amables.
->very good place to stay and walk through London
->위치도 좋고, 의사소통도 원활하고, 24체크인도 된다는 점, 아침 식사도 좋아보였습니다. 주방에서 음식을 어느 정도는 조리도 가능합니다. 가격 대비 좋은 방이였습니다. 하지만 먼지때문에 자고 일어나면 코가 안좋았습니다
->Cerca de la estación Victoria , excelente ubicación sin duda volvería a hospedarme aquí . Solo le falta un poco de limpieza a los baños pero no estaban tan mal .
->The staff where really nice :)
->Buen lugar si buscas un hostel económico en londres, ambiente tranquilo y seguro.<br/>Faltan enchufes y luz en cada cama, tuve que dejar mi celular lejos y en el suelo.<br/>El wc esta bien pero lejos del lavamanos, la ducha muy pequeña y falta un lugar donde poner tu ropa para que no se moje.
->Fácil de llegar, buena comunicación con el personal del hostel. Pero imposible comunicarse por Airbnb
