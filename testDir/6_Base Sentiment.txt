->We had a fantastic time, lovely property in a perfect location for exploring London and really safe place. The apartment was cozy with an amazing fireplace, very clean! JJ and Aleksandra were quick responding all the time, really kind couple! Defenetly recommended!
->Lovely little apartment! I have stayed on this street before so I already knew that the area is wonderful, you won’t regret staying here! It’s less than 5 minutes walk to Sloane Square station, retail shops, and food/cafes. Perfect spot and super safe! The apartment is quite small, as advertised. I stayed here alone but it would be fine for a couple too. Despite being small, it has everything you’d need for your stay in Chelsea. It’s also on the cheaper side for this area of London so it’s good value for money! Check in and check out were easy and Alexandra and JJ were responsive and nice to deal with. The space is stylish, clean and presented nicely. I look forward to staying here again!! Thanks so much Alexandra and JJ!!

->Stay from this inhuman and heartless host! I dont understand why this home is still in the listing. She cancelled the reservation and made me to move out in the middle of the stay without giving me any time to find another apartment. I had the worst time in London because of this Airbnb host but Airbnb is doing nothing to amend this. In order to prevent the same situation from happening, this home must be taken out immediateiy from Airbnb.

->The absolute highlight of my AirBnB experience.<br/>The best choice for first-time visitors to London ( and of course if you are familiar with London there is no need to explain how convenient the place and how fair the price is ) Jiawei is a multilingual super host with an enthralling life story. This will undoubtedly be my top choice in the future  下次一定还来 ～～<br/>Overall <br/>- incredibly secure place,<br/> - close to everything in the city, 3 minutes' walking distance to metro <br/>- my favourite sainsbury nearby <br/>- a wonderful spot for outdoor exercise as well <br/>- most importantly, good design and vast inside space

->Joel are very kind and chatty, the house is clean and the space is large, the location is also very good, I feel very comfortable living here, I will want to stay here again next time, I think the price is very good than staying in a hotel!!!!!!
->The host is very responsive and supportive，the location is great！<br/>Two things to keep in mind：1） There is no showing facility （only bathtub，and it's in the bedroom on the carpet）2. The temperature of the hot water from the tub i<br/>was not consistent，sometimes it became cold and last for a while （after only 11 minutes ）<br/>Overall happy with the location and service.

REVIEWS:

->Dimitry s flat is ideal for a long or short stay that s why I booked it in the past and I LL book it in the future. I like the flat because it has two parts: a small dining room and the bedroom adjacent. it is very clean and comfortable and has the added benefit if being 5 minutes from the station with a pub next door serving good food and drinks, two convenience shops that stay open latest night, a shop that sells alcoholic drinks and a cafe that opens early in the morning where you can have an English breakfast or just a coffee and a croissant. so you have all the comforts of home
->Great location right outside pimlico underground station so was a dream to find and easy check in and out.
->nice stay!!
->The apartment is really cute. Great location, easiest check in and possibly the best shower!! . Dmitry is very friendly and everything went smoothly. The only problem is had was it’s on the fourth floor and not lift and lugging a baby, a travel cot a big handbag and a suitcase wasn’t the easiest. That aside, it was great! :)
->Amazing stay for my one night trip. Very clean with cool additions like remote control skylight and bluetooth speaker in the bathroom mirrored cabinet. It was lovely and warm, close to the underground station and a pub & shops doors down from the apartment. Would definitely recommend.
->Nice Victorian set up <br/>Right in the heart of London,  free street parking from 630pm to 830 am<br/>Self check-in and check out<br/>Nice heating.<br/>20 mins walk to the American embassy, where we had an appointment
->After the first night here, I started itching and then when we returned to the room that next evening, the itching was very intense and my daughter and I saw a bed bug on the bed, we looked up what it was and quickly scooped up our belongings and went outside to then stand on the street and find a last minute booking at 11pm at night (with a child in tow). We checked in to another hotel and the itching became more intense and the bites became so huge and gathered together, and then my throat swelled up and I had trouble breathing. We called an ambulance and I ended up in a&e with an allergic reaction to a bed bug that had been biting me all night. I was there from 6am until 4pm and the doctors agreed I was bitten by a bed bug and I was having a severe allergic reaction and that had I not called an ambulance it could have been life threatening. The landlord has denied all responsibility and bearing in mind I live in a clean house and don’t travel, the bed bug came from this apartment and was brought in by one of the many travelers. I am traumatised. And just to add also, the towels are tiny and not big enough for an adult, there is no bath mat, the Matress protector had pubic hair and other dirt on it and there was no fitted sheet on top, just draped loosely over the protector. The carpet is filthy and the hospital said that bed bugs often live in the carpet of rental places. The landlord has denied all responsibility. He was told about it at 9pm at night so either had time to clean it, or didn’t look very well. But this is a bit of a horrid way to treat a victim and we certainly are shocked at the whole situation. Air bnb are also not taking this matter seriously. I’m traumatised not only by what has happened and what my daughter and I went through, and the fact that I was in a life threatening situation, but also by the way that this is not being Galen seriously and I am being blamed at bringing bed bugs in myself… don’t stay here because the landlord is really tricky and if anything happens you will have a big problem on your hands.
->VERY good communication
->The flat is small but in a very fun way! Great location right next to the tube with a wonderful little restaurant/pub next door! Be aware that the stairs on the way up are numerous and very skinny!

REVIEWS:

->Perfect location on the fast jubilee line into town. Beautiful secluded spot with a brilliant garden space. Charlie bailed me out last minute when another Airbnb cancelled last minute. Hugely accommodating and excellent communication. Thanks Charlie!
->Lovely stay at Charlie's flat - she was really helpful in advance of my visit and provided all the details I needed, including helping with parking.  The flat is lovely and in a great location - Charlie even called to check everything was ok.  I would definitely stay there again and would highly recommend it! 
->Charlie was a fantastic host! She spent time recommending restaurants for my boyfriend and I, she gave us easy to follow directions and when we arrived were given the keys by a very friendly and welcoming neighbour! Charlie took the time by making us feel very welcome with a personalised note and chocolates and giving me a call to ensure everything was okay for us! The flat was beautiful and advertised exactly right- very romantic and cosy! I loved the four poster bed and the decor is quirky and fun making me wish I could stay longer! Thankyou Charlie for a wonderful stay and making my birthday very special! 
->Had a great week in Charlie's flat. It is exactly as listed and was lovely inside. Great transport links into central London, had a supermarket, pub and a couple of cafés within walking distance too. Charlie was kind enough to leave us some milk and made contact on the arrival day to ensure all was ok. Loved having a cat as a visitor, made it feel even more homely. Would definitely recommend a stay here to anyone. Thanks 
->Charlie made us feel truly welcome with milk and tea and a brilliant, concise and personalised listing of how everything worked and where everything was. The apartment itself is stunning. Beautifully decorated  and clearly loved. It is easily found and in a gorgeous old building. The private gardens are wonderfully calm and well-kept and it's just a stone's throw from the Tube and loads of bus routes. Charlie was extremely flexible with arrival and departure times which is always a relief. My only regret is that Whisper the cat didn't pop in for a visit! Thank you Charlie for sharing. Emeline & Adrian
->My boyfriend and I had a brilliant stay at this apartment and was made so special with Charlie's help. The apartment is well looked after and really does provide a little romantic getaway. The location is great for seeing the city and getting to nearby restaurants. Charlie did ask if we minded if her cat was around and we said that was fine which was lovely to receive a little wake up call each morning. Overall really good experience with a very helpful host! 
->We had a wonderful weekend in London! Charlie was really accomodating and went above and beyond to help with the booking, our stay and tips for the area, even though we didn't get to meet. Distance to the centre is great (I'd say you get everywhere in half an hour), tube nearby. We flew in to Luton, which has a direct trainconnection to Chricklewood, approx 10 min walk from the house. The appartement is romantic/cosy and a pleasant place to stay. The cat kept sort of a respectful distance, just came in for a curious glance, probably sensing we're not catpeople. Charlie made it clear we could lock her out if we wished, but we rather enjoyed her presence in the end :)
->Had a great stay at Charlie's place and would highly recommend it for a genuine airbnb experience.  The property description is accurate and Charlie was a competent and thoughtful host especially as she was hosting at a distance.  The flat has been lovingly decorated, is supplied with essentials, and is a comfortable home away from home.  Whisper the cat was well behaved but Charlie did make clear she is an optional visitor.  The flat is close to local amenities, including a great Indian restaurant, and good transport links.  Perfect for a romantic get-away or comfortable short-stay in London.
->Beautiful flat! Warm and cosy, and charlie really made us feel at home. We didnt get to meet but she gve perfect directions and checked up to make sure things were going well. Highly recommend this airbnb flat!
->My expectations were surpassed when I arrived at Charlie's lovely flat in the Alexandra Mansions. It's a truly unique space with interesting pieces throughout, and a fabulously stocked wall of books!<br/>Charlie was a really relaxed host and made sure me and my boyfriend had all the information and reassurances we needed to facilitate an easy stay.

REVIEWS:

->This would have to be one of my favourite airbnb experiences and unfortunately, I didn't even get to meet my amazing host, Silvia. She is a truly genuine person with a beautiful personality. She was always available to assist me with any queries and/or requests that I had. She was on her own personal holiday at the time too, making her efforts all the more meaningful. The apartment is clean and very comfortable. The interior design promotes rest and relaxation and it is a truly beautiful living space. I would most definitely recommend staying here.
->Really superb host and apartment.  Loved staying here. Silvia was a very charming, warm and friendly host. The pictures are 100% accurate representation of this great apartment. Highly recommend. 
->What a beautiful place! Silvia was really friendly and prompt in response to my messages. Unfortunately I didn't get to meet her because she was away that weekend but there was a really friendly Australian couple staying who made sure I had everything I needed. The place is so light and lovely and in a quiet neighbourhood. I couldn't have asked for more! 
->I absolutely loved this place. Silvia was the perfect host and extremely flexible, friendly and responsive in all communications before and during my stay - I had just moved to London and stayed in a terrible Airbnb the previous week, so I was a bit stressed out with everything. To say I was relieved when I got to Silvias was an understatement! I was sharing with two other guests - a lovely couple from my hometown in Australia! - The apartment is bright, clean and very homely. If you want a true airbnb experience in East London - this is the place for you! Thank you Silvia - it was an absolute pleasure to have stayed in your lovely apartment & I look forward to meeting you in person soon! X
->Silvia contacted me several times before I visited, giving me details of how to get into her flat, then checked afterwards to see that all had gone smoothly and that I was comfortable, and suggesting that I text her if there were any problems. 
->It was very good stay. I really enjoyed it. I got a nice room.
->I loved staying at Silvia's place, highly recommended for anyone visiting East London looking for a peaceful and comfortable place with a fantastic host. My booking was very last minute and Silvia, even though she was out of the country, was so great with communication, arranging for me to pick up keys and making sure I had everything I needed. I extended my stay and again, Silvia was so flexible and helpful. The apartment is lovely, on the top floor of an apartment block, beautifully decorated and very peaceful, with a couple of cute budgies. It's located a ten minute walk between Hackney Central and Dalston Junction, so convenient for Overground services to take you into the city - I also found Uber useful and affordable to quickly get to places like Shoreditch High Street and Old Street. Thanks Silvia!
->I didn't meet Silvia until the last night. But her friend is very kind and helpful. The flat is tidy and full of sunshine. What a lovely place! I recommend to everyone.
->A good choice or a good chance to be host by Silvia ! what a peaceful and creative place. a very good energy into the flat. we didn't have the chance to meet her because life :) but i'm sure she's an interesting person. the mailing  communication and the organisation were perfect and clear. <br/>And the quarter is very cute. just 30min door to door by bus from St pancras ! and stoke newington is not far by walk, his quarter life is very popular, "cafe z stockey", a great place to take a coffee !<br/>Very happy :)
->Clean, artsy, excellently lit apartment. Would recommend every day of the week.

REVIEWS:

->Nice home in a fantastic place.<br/><br/>The unique problems is the clean service. Not is the best in cleaning!
->Great location, easy walking distance to oxford street and tube stations. The apartment was clean and lenn had kindly stocked up on some food for our arrival. Roses weere a lovely touch. The apartment had good heating. Lift access handy as on the top floor. Some confusion about check out time at the end (we weren't aware that we had to move out earlier than the time listed online) but the cleaner was lovely and allowed us time to finish packing.<br/>Thanks for letting us stay, we would be happy to do so again!
->Very nice apartment in amazing location.<br/>Great correspondence with the owner who seems genuinely interested in making his guests feel welcome.
->Great location, great appartement, great hospitality. We will come back! 
->There were snack and drinks left at the flat on our arrival.  A list of rules were left as well, which made things much easier to find.  The place was very clean.  The apartment was as described.  One thing to note is that there were constant parting during the night at the bar next door, which made sleeping a bit difficult at night.  The parting would stop until early morning.  Overall I would recommend this flat for those that love to be in the center of things and are not traveling with small children in need of sleep.  
->Gordon and Lenn were fantastic hosts helping out with a range of information before our arrival and leaving us some lovely welcome snacks! The apartment is in a brilliant location so close to everything and so easy to use as a base. Brilliant food and bars nearby so great just to wander Soho. Whilst the weather was abnormally hot the breeze through the lounge area made the apartment super comfortable. Plenty of room for 3 adults and 2 kids. Would definitely stay again.
->Our trip through London BnB was great. We are choosing the house right in the center and it was very handy. Gordon was against us having a good producer. Champagne was great surprises of our entering the house. Thanks Gordon
->Very good experience. Apartment was as described, clean, well-decorated, and sizeable by London standards. Not noisy despite very central location. Host was there on time and was very helpful.
->Gordon a eu la gentillesse de nous recevoir avec des friandises et des fruits, du jus de fruit et du cafe et the pour le matin...<br/>l'appartement est identique à l'annonce  avec une situation idéale dans Soho prés de tout..<br/>C'est un quartier tres vivant que nos enfants de 11 et 17 ans ont adorés... 
->What a great stay at this really nice London apartment. We were greeted as soon as we arrived by our gracious host who explained the apartment and area to us. The apartment was as good or better than described. Our host even texted us restaurant recommendations upon request throughout our stay. Only minor drawback is the area has a ton of bars so on the weekends it can be a little loud if you are a light sleeper. They installed double paned glass though which takes care of much of the noise. Would 100% stay there again should I find myself back in London

REVIEWS:

->The apartment is wonderful.
->La Petite Mademoiselle offered a fantastic location and perfectly appointed accommodations on my  most recent trip to London.  Everything about my stay was delightful and the host was attentive and responsive to any of my requests or questions.  The flat was very clean, incredibly charming, in an incredibly safe location and is well designed to allow for a maximum use of space.  I look forward to returning!
->We had a fantastic time at the apartment, loved the decor and the location is unbeatable.  We spent time in the West End and it was easy to get to from Kensington High Street, either a cab, Uber or tube.  The pub across the road is excellent as is the deli a few doors down the road.  Highly recommended.
->Megan was very attentive to our needs. The apartment was a bit flamboyant for our taste but if you’re into that, this place is perfect. Location is very nice with a café and restaurant right outside our door. 5-10 minute stroll between High Street Kensington and Earl’s Court underground stations. One block from a nice Waitrose Partners grocery store. There is a narrow spiral staircase leading up to the large bathroom. A half-bath (toilet and sink only) on the main level.
->Fantastic stay! Beautifully decorated and a great place to relax in the busy city of London! Megan was ready to help us in any way :)
->We loved this place! From check-in to check-out it was flawless. You will have trouble finding a better location in Kensington as this flat is right off the High St. (directly next door to a cafe/deli and across the street from an amazing restaurant). I highly recommend both places to eat! The flat is beautifully decorated and it felt like home for 8 days- super quiet and peaceful. Megan and Michael were very nice to work with- just can’t say enough good things about this place! <br/>10/10 xx
->Great stay, lovely flat and location. Highly recommend.
->My second time staying here.  I love it for it’s comfort and awesome location.  I was here for work and getting around London is a breeze from here.  In the city in 22 minutes was my best time on the tube and really effortless.  The pub across the road is 35 feet away, the healthy cafe is even closer and yet it’s still quiet.  Becoming my go to place when in London.
->Perfect all around, will be coming back for sure !
->Beautiful neighborhood and very thoughtfully decorated flat. Megan was very responsive when we had questions and check in was seamless. Thank you!
