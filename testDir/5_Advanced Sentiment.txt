->Nathan's apartment is spacious and clean. There are two bedrooms with double beds (although a bit small for tall Dutch people). There is a large kitchen and a good size living room. <br/>There is a little garden, at the time when we were here the landscaping was not quite finished yet.<br/>There is ample parking on the street, free of cost in the evenings and weekends.<br/>Public transport to the center of London is a bit more of a challenge. There is a train station in Loughborough and apparently a bus hub somewhere in the area but there was no info in the apartment about the connections (Nathan told us he will see to that soon).<br/>In the morning planes fly over so earplugs are a must.
->Nathan's place was a bit confusing at first from the photos. We went to the wrong house on the street however, it is the building on your right. The pictures shown were a bit misleading. The shower looks much larger in the photos, the kitchen wasn't up to my standards, and the apt looks like a quick refurbished job. You can make it work if you are there for a few days. Overall it was an ok night's rest
->Thanks Nathan. Nice clean spot. slightly difficult to find.... once we figured out the bus at the end of the Road access was much easier. <br/>Nathan left tea and coffeeand some milk for us do that was great. we were a family of 6 . Hot water for showers was great. would come again.
->Nathan was an attentive host - great communication and was quick to help with any queries.
->The place is nice and clean and the location is close to many trains and buses which I enjoyed . This place is mostly for short stays and the rooms are very spacious . The bathroom is incredibly small and the drainage is poor so you have to take quick showers. I love that the toilet and shower are in two different spots so no hogging the bathroom when you really gotta go. The sink over the toilet was weird but efficient . When I arrived we sadly had no heat and hot water, was not something you want to experience after flying in early only having to wait hours to check in. But Nathan is very responsive and fixed the issue for us  quickly and even left a bottle oh Hennessy which was very nice of him. The shower head in the bathroom was close to falling of so we were afraid to touch it and be blamed for damages …the place could use some remodeling and more art pieces on the wall to make it more homely. On Sunday their was a church or event gathering which made lots of noise in the morning but I didn’t mind because I know Africans love a celebration lol . (Just something to be wary of ) overall I enjoy the stay and enjoy Nathan’s quick fix and communication . I would most likely stay again if the prices were a little cheaper but overall I enjoyed my stay as I was mostly experiencing london . Thank you Nathan !
->Had a great stay in London. <br/>The place reflects the images in the listing well.<br/>Nathan’s flat was clean, cozy,with quick access to transport and convenience stores nearby.<br/>Communication with the host was perfect, replying almost instantly to any query.<br/>Overall, really enjoyed my time there and would definitely come back in the near future.
->Nathan was really easy to communicate with and was really helpful if we had any issues.
->Nice apartment!
->The flat was clean and had everything we needed. Great for a few days.
->Great stay for the price.  Public transportation everywhere. The place is A little outside of the sites in London, but you can get to them just fine.

->Ubicación estupenda cerca de las atracciones principales y bien comunicada tanto por metro como por bus.<br/>Limpieza y amplitud del apartamento sumado a la comodidad y que no le falta de nada, han conseguido que nos sintamos en nuestra propia casa. Cama cómoda. Baños fantásticos. Cocina equipada. Wifi funciona muy bien. Muy tranquilo para descansar por las noches. Los propietarios atentos y accesibles. Recomendaría a mis amigos y familia o cualquier persona que quiera disfrutar Londres.
->we had a great time. hosts or their team was available for every question with fast response time. location was unique 15 minutes walk from Thames, 5 min to underground yet a very quiet neighborhood.<br/>apartment itself is very spacious, bedrooms and bathroom were very big and modern. <br/>living room and rooms have big windows,  terraces enablin a lot of sun.
->This is a great flat in the city - beautifully appointed. Inflatable bed was a bit odd as it was in the master bedroom....but I would highly recommend the flat.
->Good place to stay in London 
->David and Paul’s home is beautiful and a real joy for your stay in London. Tons of nearby buses, tubes and taxis, plus an easy 30 min walk to the London Eye and the Thames. The bedrooms are spacious and the leafy outlook is super relaxing after a hard day of sightseeing. The hosts are really responsive with any queries and gave us good advise about getting around in London. Good wifi too. The stairs between the two floors of the home are quite steep and can be tough on the knees (we had all just done the West Highland Way so our knees were knackered!) but other than hat we loved our stay. Highly recommended. 
->Great stay at David's apartment. Accurate pictures and description. Bedrooms are on separate floors, which provides an additional level of privacy.  If you are looking for the freezer, the modern kitchen has it tucked away separately under the counter. For coffee drinkers the options are french press, vintage-style stovetop percolator, or instant. Air conditioners are located in each bedroom and sufficiently cooled the apartment when it was 80F outside. <br/>It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the tube. However, uber rides to Greater London were 6-10 GBP and was an easier door-to-door travel option. It's also less costly if you are traveling with a family or group. A number of restaurants, take away, and grocery options within a 5-10 minute walk. Neighborhood is residential and safe.<br/>One thing to note is that the google street view didn't match the modern look of the apartment. David's apartment can't be seen on the google street view because it's through the black gate, which opens to a nice private courtyard prior to accessing the apartment in the back.
->No service at all !!! But first class apartment at good calm location, you will find everything that you need for your stay in the apartment.<br/>One bedroom has air mattress which is comfortable though.<br/>No service is regarding an issue we faced with check in which was promised at 3:00 pm but instead it was ready by 8:00 pm only as we had to stay there for the cleaner to clean it up and our whole first day got wasted and we were provided with bath towels set 1 peice for each guest and we were promised the first day that we will be provided with new towel set 1 peice for each guest and were given the same assurance for 6 days but no towels reached out to us so the third day we bought new towels any ways.<br/>They charge about 50£ for late check out but what about late check in they should compensate too.<br/>PS :- Lovely apartment highly recommend but beware of services provided by the team.
->We had a nice stay in the appartment. <br/>Perfect location, great house!<br/>Contact with Paul was good and he helped use perfect.

REVIEWS:

->The property is newly renovated with 2 double beds bedrooms.  Although the living is not big, there was Flat TV with Netflix ready.  The kitchen is fully equipped and provided with coffee machine, tea bags and snacks.  The only problem we have is the premise is located on the 4 storey which means there are stairs to climb, so make sure you don’t have large and heavy luggages or you are strong to carried them all the way up.
->The apartment had modern interior and was very clean. Beautiful view and was a great space for 3 people. Everything we needed was provided and Niyi answered within the hour even minutes. Only one thing we missed was air conditioning having in mind that it was a hot summer week.
->This place was great, especially for the price! Very clean and neat.
->This is an extremely clean and comfortable flat. We felt very safe and the public transport into London was easy to manage. Great value for money for up to 5 people.
->rien a dire l'appartement est très propre et moderne , le quartier est super déplacement facile en bus, les magasins à côté, et l'hôte est très gentil et serviable.<br/>je reviendrai avec plaisir et je recommande à 100%
->Logement très propre et très bien équipé. 2 belles et grandes chambres. Séjour agréable avec son petit balcon avec vue sur les gratte-ciels londoniens. C'est très calme et bien isolé. Le quartier n'est pas particulièrement joli mais pas de problème de sécurité. En plus, on est en 30 minutes en bus des principaux monuments de Londres.Nous avons laissé notre voiture immatriculée en France pendant 4 jours dans la rue sans problème. Bref, c'est très agréable et un bon rapport qualité prix ! Merci encore pour cet agréable séjour
->Lovely apartment and excellent communication with Niyi. Easy commute into central London with buses and using the tube. Would happily stay again
->We enjoyed our stay at the apartment. In a  20/30 minutes bus ride you're at the main tourist attractions in London. The apartment was big and all the facilities where clean. We recommend staying here!

->Casa molto confortevole, con tutto il necessario per preparare delle ottime colazioni, in ottima posizione, a pochi metri sia dalla fermata del bus che al centro tra le fermate della Tube di Kennington e Vauxhall. Appena ristrutturata, si trova in un quartiere molto tranquillo, dove abbiamo scoperto degli ottimi pub nelle immediate vicinanze. L'unica nota negativa è il letto con i cuscini un po' scomodi. Foto molto veritiere. Grazie di tutto Pablo.
->Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour dans cette charmante maison lumineuse. Chacune des pièce est fidèle aux photos et les espaces bien aménagés. La maison est à proximité des commerces (Tesco à 3mn) et des transports. Pablo est un hôte très arrangeant et aux bons soins. Merci pour tout! Mailinh
->Le logement de Pablo est vraiment magnifique : spacieux, lumineux, terrasse très agréable, proche des transports en commun (20-25 minutes du centre en métro ou en bus) et le Tesco est à deux minutes!<br/>Nous n'avons pas rencontré Pablo mais bien un de ses amis qui nous a remis les clefs et expliqué le fonctionnement de la maison. <br/>Bref, excellent séjour dans un environnement très agréable!
->Mi familia y yo nos hemos sentido como en nuestra propia casa. La vivienda de Pablo es muy cómoda, sus camas son grandes. Tiene un supermercado Tesco a menos de 3 min andando. Estación de metro de Vauxhall y Kenington a menos de 10 min andando, 25 min andando al Big Ben, muy bien comunicado. Trato muy agradable y fácil comunicación tanto por parte de Pablo como de sus amigos que nos recibieron.
->The house is located in a quite but safe neighbourhood, the house is spacious and clean with lots of sunshine! With 3 double-bed rooms, a group of 6 has no problem to fit in the house at all.<br/><br/>There is a Tesco within 2 mins talk and it's around 10 mins walk to either Vauxhall or Kennington station. From most of the tourist spots (ie. Oxford Circus, Piccadilly...), it's around 8-10 pounds by taking Uber :)<br/><br/>I highly recommend everyone to spend their London days at this wonderful house!  
->La casa de Pablo es preciosa, recién reformada, amplia....las fotos no le hacen justicia. Capacidad suficiente para seis personas. Destacar sobre todo la existencia de dos baños completos y un aseo, algo muy de agradecer cuando estas fuera de casa "compartiendo" piso. Por último destacar la ubiación, a 5 minutos caminando de la estación de Vauxal y a 10-15 minutos del Big-Ben. Han sido unas vacaciones fantásticas. Repetiremos sin duda.
->We loved Pablo's house!  Great communication in the lead up to our trip and Pablo kindly arranged that we could drop our bags early on the day of our arrival.  His friend, Phil, met us and showed us around.  The house is clean, bright, comfortable and well-appointed with a beautiful kitchen and back yard with big opening doors.  Our 14-year-old son was delighted to discover the PS4 and this saved us from teenage grumps!!!  The area is great, a short walk through a beautiful Georgian square to the nearest tube station, lots of restaurants and pubs and a big supermarket within a few minutes stroll.  Would definitely stay here again.
->The house is much better than we expected! The host respond quickly and is very responsible. The house is very clean and with all the amenities you need. We especially enjoyed the kitchen, we cooked breakfast every day. The location is good, the neighbourhood is queit and cozy, with a TESCO just in 3-min walking distance. This house is fantastic for a group of friends and family to stay, this is certainy our first choice when we visit London again.
->La estancia ha sido estupenda, ya que la casa ofrece todas las comodidades para pasar unos dias. Por otro lado, la ubicación es muy buena, porque es una zona tranquila y muy bien conectada con el centro de Londres. La atención del anfitrión ha sido genial y principalmente la atención de los vecinos. 
->Fantastic in every sense!!! The best airbnb house in London if you ask me for service, value, location and style! :)

Comfortably accommodates 2 guests.
REVIEWS:

->The flat has a really good location especially if you love running as it is very close to Hyde Park. However it lacks central lighting so with the two side lamps it gets very dark at night and definitely would not describe it as bright. The pictures show the flat with and without the bed so it’s not as big as it would appear on the ad. There were a couple of issues on my arrival, which probably should’ve been checked, but great communication with the host and resolved promptly. The flat was generally clean when I arrived however the wardrobe interiors were covered in dust that I cleaned myself. Small things but they make all the difference.
->Sofia’s place was absolutely lovely and in a super prime location! truly a stones throw away from Hyde Park and Lancaster Gate! I booked parking across the street in Corus Hotel’s parking lot through JustPark app! Sofia was always available to check in about anything and always kindly fulfilled any requests I had to make my long stay comfortable  such as moving out an extra arm chair etc. Wifi always worked fast and smooth!Overall a fantastic stay for several weeks! Lot’s of towels and bedding! Would heartily recommend anyone! 😍
->perfect location!
->I had a wonderful stay at Sophia’s studio flat. The flat was clean, comfortable and in the perfect location for my month abroad. I will miss my morning walks in Hyde Park with the perfect flat white which was an easy walk from this flat. The Italian restaurant below was wonderful as well and the staff was incredibly kind. If I had any questions or concerns, Sophia was able to address them quickly and with kindness and grace. I am already planning my next trip to London and would love to stay with Sophia again.
->Perfect place to stay near Paddingtonstation and Hydepark
->Sofia’s flat was just as described and in a great location. It was easy to get the the tube and the entry to Kensington Park was a very short walk. The cafes right near the flat were impeccable. The Indian food down the street was the best I’ve ever had. I recommend  and would stay again.
->Sofia’s flat was very convenient home base for our travels. A less-than-10 minute walk to Paddington station!
->I have been in this place whole month and it was a great apartment! It’s small but comfortable and the localization is really great! Sofia also is a great host. When I had problem with something she tried to help me and fixed the problem. I can’t wait to come back to this place. 😊❤️
->Great place in a great location.  Paddington and Hyde Park just a few minutes walk and some great places to eat and drink in the neighbourhood.<br/>Although in a lively location the place is extremely quiet both morning and night.  The flat had everything we needed and was very comfortable.  Also felt really safe.<br/>Would recommend!
->Great location! Small simple place. Only complaint would be the comfort of the bed and pillows. We enjoyed our stay!

->We really enjoyed our trip and the flat was really nice.
->Good flat, clean , well equiped, convenient. Very good communication . I recommand
->The apartment is really clean and not to far from the undergoung, but we were 6 friends and thought it was a bit bigger that it showed on the photos. Perfect for a week end.(short stay) the communication with Reuven was perfect and the check in was really easy. Nice stay overall.
->The flat was lovely and clean, bedroom beautiful and comfortable, bathroom very clean and great large shower. Everything we needed was provided, iron hairdryer kitchen equipment etc. Towels were changed regularly which is unusual for an air bnb. Great service, like a hotel. Only thing to know is that you don't know which flat you will get and we had one on the top floor which may have been smaller than the others pictured, or the pictures showed a larger living area than in reality. Other than that great stay and good value for London. Area itself is not especially nice but it has shops and basic restaurants and buses close by and is about a 10 minute walk to the tube which is short ride to centre of London.
->Super séjour ! L’appartement est très propre et fonctionnel ! <br/>Je recommande vivement pour un week end à Londres !
->Reuven is a wonderful host who will answers all your questions and very fast; really kind and with a great humor, his apartments are great if you are looking for staying for a few days in London: Comfy, clean, with everything it's needed (even hairdryer and sleepers!!). With bus stop just down the road, and restaurants and pubs very close. Loved being there!!
->Close to the underground. Small but cosy appartment. Great communication from owner.
->More amenities in bathroom and more towel hanger
->Lovely apartment, very close to high road and public transport.
->An excellent property for 4 people sharing, or maybe even 5!<br/>Very clean and fabulously located. Easy travel to central London, or even in the other direction.<br/>Would definitely reccomend and use again.

It’s also really close to public transport and in walking distance to Waterloo as well as lot’s of the touristy spots. <br/>Very friendly and accommodating hosts, whom were always reachable and incredibly kind. We most certainly felt at home. The apartment couldn't have been more perfect, so we'd definitely recommend to stay there.
->Great place to stay at. Mario was a great host. Always in touch and responded to all our questions promptly. Will definitely recommend and stay again
->The flat is located right on the elephant & castle station so I had a super commute into the city while I stayed at Mario's. There are tons of public bikes that get you there quickly! The pictures are accurate and the space is comfortable and functional. <br/>Mario was a courteous and attentive host, having responded almost instantly to all our queries. Thanks for everything!
->It is really nice flat in city center. It is around 20 minutes to the bigben  by walking. I racommend to use bycicles - it costs 2£ per day . If you are looking nice flat in center , this is the best choice! 🙂

->Kleine, aber feine Wohnung in einem typischen Londoner Haus. Die Lage ist echt gut. In einer Seitenstraße, aber 2-3 Gehminuten weg von einer großen Bushaltestelle und einer U-Bahnstation. Von diesen Stationen kommt man dann problemlos innerhalb absehbarer Zeit in die ganze Stadt! <br/>Die Wohnung ist etwas klein, aber für 2-4 Leute super geeignet. Die Räume sind durch zwei Türen getrennt  und das Bad ist auch groß genug. Die Küche ist ausreichend um ein gutes Frühstück zu machen oder Kleinigkeiten zu kochen.<br/>Die Betten waren gut, Ausstattung war alles vorhanden und sauber war die Wohnung weitestgehend auch! <br/>Empfehlenswert und gemütlich an regnerischen Tagen!

REVIEWS:

->We had a great time staying here for 1 week. We loved the place as it was, as advertised, very clean and tidy as well as being in a great location in central London. The bed was very comfotable, the couch was great, the kitchen facilities were perfect and it seemed that the bathroom and the bathtub were newly renovated, very clean and nice. The apartment is on the top floor of the apartment which was great because it could let the daylight in due to the little windows on the ceiling both in the bedroom and the bathroom. The only downside may be that there is no lift for someone who is not prepared to carry luggages up and down but i think that there is a small price to pay for the location it is in. The apartment is spacious enough for 2 people for sure and friends can crash over at the sofa bed comfortably if privacy is not too much of a concern. Vito was a great host, he arranged everything very smoothly for our stay, kept in touch when we needed him and had someone professional to greet us when we arrived to show us the apartment and answer any questions we might have had. We are sure to stay here again when we re-visit London!
->Great space, comfortable in a very convenient locale just north of Oxford Street. Easily accessible from Heathrow and to all  main tourist attractions. Fantastically comfortable bed, not so comfortable pull out sofa bed.  Shower was luxurious! <br/>We were a late check in (9pm) and only after we had accepted booking were we told we would have to pay a £25 late check in fee. Also upon check in, we were told that there was a problem with the oven, we could use either the cooktop or the oven but not both at the same time- the lovely lady that checked us in advised us that this was going to be fixed the day after we left.  It was difficult to move luggage up to and from the third floor ( maybe 60 stairs), but that being said it was advertised as such. <br/>Communication was prompt and efficient with with Vito and the ladies that orchestrated check in. I only wish the weather had been more conducive to enjoy the lovely rooftop deck...maybe next time. 
->Great location, bars, restaurants, all types of shops, tube & bus very near.  The flat (gorgeous deco), great roof terrace, everything had been thought through to make our stay ideal. Full of nice attentions: hairdryer, coffee & tea, soap & shampoo, 2 mobiles for local use, etc ... Feeling of being at a friend's place.<br/>The (best Italian) landlord and the welcoming team are  very nice and helpful. Excellent stay, we strongly recommend.
->Vito's place is truly a gem! It is exactly as portrayed in the photos and description of the apartment. Loved the contemporary look of the apartment and it felt very bright and airy with all its skylight. The place was fully equipped, very clean and quiet, though situated on a street with lots of lovely shops, restaurants and all conveniences. Having lived in London before, I would say Vito's place is unbeatable in terms of location. It is exactly as he described it to be,close to all major sites and transportation. Round the block from his place is Manchester Sq, which is lovely and The Wallace collection is right there. Vito himself is a wonderful host, very helpful and prompt with replies from beginning till the end our stay. His staff was professional and was there waiting for us when we arrived. Everything went very smoothly and we would definitely recommend his place and would love to stay again. And he feels like a friend !!
->Vito and Anita (the property manager) are really involved, helpful and effective. The flat is well designed with a lot things (TV, WiFi, 2 mobile phones...) and a real kitchen. <br/>The location is great, close to Bond Street station. <br/>
->A lovely little space with everything you could want at your doorstep.  The roof deck was lovely even though it was too cold to use it and the concierge service was spot on.  The flat was tidy and clean, the bed was comfy and there were no problems or issues.
->Host and his team are easy to communicate with, and are clear & straightforward from the moment you message them.  Apartment itself is fine, most of it's value arises from the fact that it is in a great location, close to many restaurants, parks, shopping, and public transportation.
->Vito is a gracious host<br/>I used to live in London so I know it well and this flat i s in the best location. Well equipped, beautifully done up and perfectly located, but it's the roof terrace that really does it. Overlooking the heart of Marylebone village, I had great weather and enjoyed it from the terrace looking out at the neighbourhood.<br/>The intercom wasn't working so if you're hosting like me it's a tiny bit of a hassle to run down the stairs to let guests in. Apart from that this flat is fawless and really lives up to it's billing as a true gem in the heart of London. <br/>I look forward to visiting again.
->Fantastic host with a beautiful Apartment.<br/><br/>I have had over 4 different stays in London with different Airbnb hosts/locations but I would have to say that Vito and his apartment is my favourite out of all of them.<br/><br/>I will definitely reserve the apartment for my next stay in London.
->Hermoso departamento. Excelente ubicación en una zona ideal para enamorarse de Londres. <br/>Vitto y su equipo ofrecen todo lo necesario para tener una estadía placentera en el departamento. Lo recomiendo un 100%!!!

->We were warmly welcome and we found a full cornucopia full with fresh and juicy fruit . Abundance of water in the fridge. Thank you so much.<br/>However never trust Nils and Serge. They cancelled my reservation and I had to struggle to get another one as I was traveling abroad. AIRBNB MUST BE IN TOUCH WITH ME<br/>
->Very convenient place to stay for me, with it only being 10 mins walk to where I was working, also great access to central London from Seven Sisters. Very nice kitchen facilities and great wifi. Overall a really good experience.

If you are driving, make sure you talk to the host about parking permits before you arrive. Parking permits are required from 8am - 6:30pm Monday through Saturday. The host is super responsive and overall our stay was great.

->Home clean and spacious; accessories avalaibility.<br/>Near parking, cheap and convenient
->If you're thinking of exploring north London, Antonia's house is a wonderful place to do it from. The house itself has had a modern renovation inside, so all the facilities and fittings are new and very clean. The host - Antonia - is in close communication to make sure everything is ok when you arrive. There is also a bowl of fruit provided which was most welcome. Transport to central London is only a 10 min walk to Seven Sisters underground station or buses. Overall, it was wonderful staying here and couldn't recommend it more.

->Great stay in South London! Very cozy, comfy little place with good amenities, right by a bus stop and convenience stores. Mark is very nice- I’d recommend staying here. :-)
->Mark's place is nice and cosy. In a quiet residential area next to Brockwell park, one of my favourite parks in London, and Herne Hill, with a few nice pubs. Mark was a very helpful host too!
->The flat is very quirky and fully of character. It was clean and Mark was a great host! He was welcoming and made my friend and I feel like we were staying at a home away from home. The place is such a great value for money and I would definitely stay here again.
->Mark was friendly, room was fine!
->Mark is a really nice guy, and his place is close to hip Brixton, and accessible by bus from central London (Marylebone, Victoria and Vauxhaull for example) which was practical & cheap. The only thing (which really isn't Mark's fault!) is that the flat smelt of humidity - up to you to decide if that's a deal breaker or not, and there was a dehumidifier, which may help!
->Great host and a great space, Mark is a nice guy with patience and a good personality to match. He made us feel at home for 10 days, It seems far on map but only 12 mins train to heart of london to Black friars next to Tate Modern, South Bank which is amazing. <br/>You wont be disappointed.
->Quiet, clean and safe place. Friendly host
->Mark was brilliant at communicating and very welcoming on our arrival despite the fact that London did its worst and we were an hour and a half later than proposed arrival time. <br/>The space is clean, and very comfortable. The room is compact, but priced to reflect this so offers excellent value. We would definitely stay again.
->Thank you so much for having us! We had a great stay in London, and had very restful sleep in your accomodation. All the best in all your endeavors Mark!
->Mark was very friendly and welcoming, gave us some great tips for getting around.<br/>The room was clean and warm, at the quiet location by the park. Everything you need in order to have a good nights sleep! <br/>We had to leave for the airport at 2am and we did not have any problems with the transport at all, as there are night busses very close to the house. <br/>We had a nice stay and great time in London!

->Un excellent séjour chez Phil pendant plus d'une semaine.<br/>L'appartement est très bien situé dans Londres. Le bus 12 au bout de la rue dessert les lieux les plus touristiques. Plus une ligne direct bus ou métro pour Saint Pancras (Eurostar). C'est donc très facile de naviguer.<br/>Quant à l'appartement lui-même, il est suffisamment spacieux pour une famille de 4 et bien aménagé.<br/>Dans le quartier, il y a tout ce que l'on peut rechercher : supermarché, pharmacie, poste... C'est un quartier populaire, en pleine mutation. <br/>Nous n'avons pas eu la chance de rencontrer Phil mais tout était très bien organisé pour nous accueillir et nous donner des conseils.<br/>Une adresse à retenir absolument.
->We arrived the apartment very late at night after a delay in our flight.  Phil was there waiting for us.  He was very nice and gave us the keys and all the explanations we needed about the place.  His place is central, quite big and convenient. The beds covers and towels clean.  There is a construction site in front of the place so that it's rather noisy starting from 08:00 am. 
->Hi Phil. Thank your for your hospitality and letting use your home during our brief stay in London. We had a wonderful time and managed well once we figured out the bus and Underground system. The proximity to all public transportation was great help. Also the Taxi service you recommended worked perfect. They were very punctual picking us up. So sorry most of my time in the UK was spent battling a terrible cold. Gracias!
->est sa localisation. A 2 pas du métro et du train, il est notamment très facile à rejoindre depuis l'aéroport Gatwick.<br/>Sympathique et ponctuel, Phil fait en sorte que ses hôtes se sentent comme à la maison.<br/>Un plan idéal pour un séjour de quelques jours à Londres en famille ou entre amis, puisqu'il y a au moins la place pour 4. Proprete peut etre amelioree
->Phil was an extremely nice and helpful host. Didn't get a chance to actually meet him but he helped sort out a couple of minor things promptly. Apartment itself is good and clean, although the building and the hall carpeting is a little run-down but it doesn't matter much when in the apartment. Would def stay here again.
->Phil is a really nice host. He warmly welcomed us when we got to the apartment, gave us a few tips about the neighborhood, etc. He was very flexible on our schedules (arriving and departing).<br/><br/>The apartment was clean and very quiet. It is also very close to the subway, and to the bus stop (zone 1), it's really easy to go around from there.<br/><br/>Thank you very much !! 
->Phil's apartment was a great place to stay! It's comfy and conveniently located a short walk away from the tube. Phil waited for us until 1am beacause of our late flight. Highly recommend.
->When I initially booked, Phil was very responsive which was great. He was not as easy to get ahold of once I was there, but he did answer eventually. He changed my check-in time last-minute which messed up my plans but he offered to refund me some money for the inconvenience so that was nice.<br/><br/>The flat itself was as pictured yet still not what I expected - be prepared to feel like you're sleeping in someone's else place. All his stuff is still there - clothes, personal effects, photographs, etc. It's pretty strange, even my local friends thought so. Be aware there is no microwave, but there is a stove range/oven. There is a washer/dryer but know it can only handle a small load of clothes. <br/><br/>The bathroom is huuuuge but make sure you put a big towel down as there's no shower curtain (and the tiny glass wall does nothing). Water pressure was fine, though a bit of mold/scum fell off the metal piece that holds the shower head (eek). Could definitely be tidier, but I'm not that picky. Also, the window in the bathroom has just a thin veil which I'm not totally convinced keeps the neighbors across the way from watching you shower/pee, but I could be wrong haha ;) <br/><br/>If you have mobility issues, note that this flat is on the second level of the building and you must walk up a set of narrow stairs. Plus a few more stairs up to your main living area. <br/><br/>The area of Elephant & Castle is kinda shady, especially very early morning or after dark. I'm a 31-year-old woman and I did not feel safe walking around alone. The flat is at the end of a quiet road surrounded by construction which was unnerving to walk at night but I think it was actually safer/better than the main road. Also, if you fancy sleeping in, know that the construction starts up at 8am and is quite loud. It didn't bother me as I was out the door early everyday. <br/><br/>The E&C tube is about a 5-8 minute walk (I suggest cutting through the rail station) and you can easily connect to most places from there. As for food, there are a variety of options close-by plus a Tesco's at the E&C shopping center. I especially liked Jennys Restaurant in the shopping center for American-style food or a delicious jacket potato. There were many buses on the main road but I did not use them. <br/><br/>Phil is a nice and seemingly honest host, the place just took a little adjusting to for me personally. Was a new experience for sure! 
->Phil è stato estremamente gentile e disponibile, molto flessibile sui nostri orari di arrivo e partenza.<br/>L'appartamento è comodo, pulito e situato vicino alla metropolitana e agli autobus.<br/>Ci siamo trovati veramente bene!<br/>Grazie mille!<br/>
->Appartement conforme aux photos. Parfait pour 4 personnes. Propre et bien aménagé. <br/>L'appartement est dans une maison au style typiquement anglais. Il est bien situé, le métro et commodités relativement proche. Le bus est au bout de la rue, et amène à big ben et picadilly en 10min. <br/>Nous n'avons pas rencontré Phil mais les échanges ont été rapide et cordiaux. Phil à ete très arrangeant pour les horaires. <br/>Une bonne adresse !

->The apartment was super cozy and clean. We enjoyed the fresh sheets and comfy beds. Also such a bonus to have a yard! The place is bigger than it looks and we were very comfortable there. We also loved the park right behind us - great for kids, with playground, sand pit and nice for a jog. <br/>Would recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the London area ;)
->Lovely home in a great location. Clare and Matt were great hosts, very responsive and nice extra touches like leaving things for breakfast and recommendations for places to eat/things to do. Would stay again - thank you!
->Matt & Clare’s space was fantastic. The train information from Heathrow to their place made for a seamless and easy journey, especially for us who had no idea what we were doing. <br/>The house was small however the space was set up really well and we felt as though there was more than enough room for the five of us. We especially loved being able to use a washing machine and dryer. <br/>Matt & Clare provided eggs, fresh sourdough bread and the amenities allowed us to cook a home cooked meal which was a welcomed novelty after travelling around ! (Plus a coffee machine!!) <br/>Matt & Clare also provided an extensive list of things to do, and places to eat at which was so helpful for us London novices !<br/>The beds were so comfortable as was everything in the house, thank you again Matt & Clare.
->Beautiful accommodation amd extremely helpful hosts
->Absolutely fantastic. The apartment is well furnished and the hosts helpful. I would highly recommend.
->Clare was a perfect host who made sure that we arrived safely and had a comfortable stay. She had left us a few basics in food and beverages which was a nice touch and very welcome after our 6 hour drive. The house was warm, very clean and comfortable. We shall be back I am sure.
->Lovely apartment in a nice street. Lovingly  furnished and decorated in a quiet neighbourhood. Close to Lloyd Park and 15mins to the centre of Walthamstow. No hesitation in recommending.
->Lovely spacious flat, everything you need and homely.<br/>Clare was very helpful and communication was good. Very good value for the price
->Overall good stay. Upstairs neighbours a bit noisy.
->Nice cosy place to stay if you want to visit Londen. It’s a 15 minute walk to the underground, and a 20 minute ride to the centre of Londen. The house has all the comfort you need, good beds, nice living room, a fully equipped kitchen, and a great bathroom. Also the neighbors cat Frank is very friendly, and welcomes you every time : ). We traveled with our kids, and there was enough space for the 4 of us. We also would recommend the Turtle bay restaurant in Walthamstow if you are looking for a nice place to eat. We went there twice in our 4 day trip!

-><br/>We (four persons) were well received by Adam and his wife. They are very friendly and as we had some questions, they were answered by him really good, so that there are no misunderstanding. We have been in London the first time and so he gave us some advice what we can do. <br/>The room is established very nice and comfortable. All criteria in the booking info matched with the room.<br/>We also had some breakfast and the tee with milk was really good, since we don´t know that in Austria.<br/>I can highly recommend Adam and I will definitely go again to him when I stay in London. The Position is really good, walking to the overground only takes about 7 minutes. From there you can take the train to Victoria Station and it only takes 10/15 Minutes so you are pretty fast in the middle of town/near of Big Ben.<br/> <br/>
->Adam was a superb host. I had to arrive late due to an unprecedented cold spell and Adam was very flexible and even stayed up to help with the check in and take all our luggage into the house. The house is absolutely stunning - (the photos don't do it justice), which we learned was designed by Adam (hats off!). The room was enormous, clean and fit with extra touches like 3 different types of tea. We had a newborn baby and so had to make a few extra demands and nothing was too much trouble. Adam has a lovely family who we were fortunate to meet during our stay and even took time to chat to us and enjoy a whiskey or two! Herne Hill is a wonderful place to be based as it has good transport links and Adam gave us some recommendations of pubs - true to his word the half moon delivered a wonderful roast. There are loads of brilliant places to eat brunch and the house very close to Brockwell park for a nice Sunday walk. All in all we were over the moon with our stay and hope to be back soon.
->Spacious, light and stylish room. Beautifully decorated with comfortable mattresses and lovely modern bathroom. The hosts were friendly and attentive. Only a very short walk from the centre of Herne Hill with short rail link to the tube network
->Adam and his family are great hosts- we were only in the area for a night travelling from another part of London by car- Adam’s place was as described and had everything we needed and very well located for the local Dulwich area. On site parking was a bonus for us and allowed us to ditch the car and walk around and explore neighbourhood. Would stay again if we were in the area.
->I enjoyed the hospitality in Adam‘s very  comfortable house.  Spacious, cosy   bedroom with stylish bathroom.  Adam‘s house is in short walking distance to the station with very good train service to central London ( to Victoria less than 10 minutes)
->Perfect stopping off place for us.  Good for visiting London, too. Comfortable, convenient. Well placed.
->Any transportation such as bus and train is really close to his house.
->Perfect hosts and lovely accomodation in an extremely convenient location.  Highly recommended
->Adam's house is in a wonderful pocket of London, easily accessible by transport with lots of restaurants, cafes and pubs nearby available as there is no access to the kitchen. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. The small bar fridge in the room is useful. Adam and Phili were friendly, considerate and helpful hosts and flexible with check in/check out times, which was appreciated.
->Belle maison. Chambre conforme à l'annonce. 25 min de l'hypercentre de Londres en transport en commun. Grande disponibilité (à notre arrivée à 14h un vendredi !) et hôtes très sympathiques.

->The apartment was truly fantastic and exactly as described, the spacious garden and the tasteful interior design made us feel right at home. Everything we needed was provided. <br/><br/>Its location right in the center of beautiful Clerkenwell is ideal for reaching any point in central London within twenty minutes via Bus or Tube.<br/><br/>There are several spectacular restaurants and coffee shops nearby, and a small supermarket is right next to it. <br/><br/>Our hosts went above and beyond and made our trip to London a wonderful experience. From the point we arrived at the apartment they gave us a warm welcome, explained everything and also gave us tons of tips for our visit. Even during our stay we could reach them at any time.<br/><br/>For our next stay in London we will definitely come back here!
->Amir and Johnny are the warmest of hosts. I was met at the flat with flowers and wine. They were always available to answer questions and eager to make my stay as awesome as it was. The flat is a total gem only  minutes from all the London sights. The garden is just beautiful and relaxing after a bust day. The location has everything you would need with a wide variety of restaurants and tube within just minutes walk from the flat.  I give this flat and the hosts five stars and cant wait to go back for another stay as soon as possible.
->My daughter and I stayed for 9 days at Johnny and Amir's place and just loved it!  Fab furnishings, spacious accomodations, gorgeous deck, and very hospitable hosts.  Loved it!  Hope to make this my regular pad in London...
->The hosts of this property could not have been more helpful. From accommodating the needs of myself and my family to providing helpful tips and recommendations about the immediate area and what it had to offer. They were also kind enough to have the basics as well as some wine and other complimentary items available. <br/><br/>The apartment was clean, it was spacious as well as stylish and the garden to the rear an added bonus. It is exceptionally located for bars and restaurants as well as accessibility to a number of other key London locations.<br/><br/>Arrangements for access was simple and entry was self explanatory, as was the functionality of the property. <br/><br/>We would (and probably will) return to stay at the apartment if it has not become booked out solid by the time we look to revisit!<br/><br/>I genuinely could not recommend the property or the hosting experience more. You will not be disappointed. <br/><br/>
->We have just spent 9 nights here for work and the apartment made everything so much easier and felt like a home away from home. It is very well equipped and perfectly comfortable, easily spacious enough for four people. The garden is a real bonus, lovely to have a bit of peace and tranquillity in such a busy area. The location is excellent, minutes away from Farringdon tube station with lovely restaurants and coffee shops just across the road. There's even a Sainsburys two doors down for all your essentials. <br/>Amir kindly met us on arrival and showed us around, even left us wine and fresh flowers - very thoughtful (and appreciated!)<br/>I absolutely wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and have already recommended it to friends.
->We had the best vacation in London!  Thank you Johnny and Amir for letting us stay in your beautiful apartment!  The location was great as we were so close to so many things.  The back yard was particularly delightful!  Johnny answered all our questions immediately and gave us a lot of helpful information.  There were no pictures of the bathroom on the airbnb site but it was just a delightful as the rest of the apartment. 
->Top notch experience.  Would stay there again.  Description of unit - accurate. Pre check in coordination - helpful and easy.  Check in - on time.  Stay - great; unit was comfortable, functional, in a great area- close to various neighborhoods of interest; well protected from outside sound; high quality in general- windows, plumbing, electric, Internet etc.  Private garden a huge plus.
->We had a lovely time! The whole experience was above our expectations from the great welcome at the appartment with fresh fruit, wine and flowers until we left the appartment. The appartment is spacious, clean, equiped with all the appliances neeed to make your stay as comfortable as being at your own home. Big windows offer a lot of day light. Neighborhood is nice, there's a local shop just besides the appartment and a lot of restaurants so you can easily go out for a luch or dinner. We plan to come back as soon as possible!
->We stayed at Johnny's apartment - two adults and two kids under 3 for 3 nights. The apartment size was better than expected for such a central location and had everything we required. We were met at the apartment on time and given a quick tour before we made ourselves at home over a complimentary bottle of wine.<br/>The street had everything we required with a few supermarkets, bars, train station and restaurants in walking distance. We can highly recommend the Foxlow restaurant 2 doors down. We couldn't access the garden due to building works while we were there which Johnny had warned us about and reflected in the rate but from what we could see it is an excellent addition to a lovely apartment. 
->An unforgettable experience in London: the apartment is wonderfully furnished, perfect central location.<br/>Johnny and Amir welcomed us very warmly, with fresh flowers, sparkling wine - and not to forget a huge list of restaurant & shop recommendations!<br/>Since the weather was good, we could enjoy the garden, which is perfect for a little pause during a city trip!<br/>Thank you so much again for the "late check-out" and everything!<br/><br/>

->A great place to stay
->Justyna and Greg are really nice and kind, always available to help you. The accomodation is in a beautiful and quiet area. Connections are really good, in fact the flat is only two minutes walk from the subway and it is really easy to reach Central London. Both the bedroom and the bathroom are large, beautiful and clean. A private car park is available in a safe area. The flat is brand new, elegant and really clean. Guests are welcome to use the kitchen and I had space in the cupboard and in the fridge for my food. This accomodation is perfect for both long and short stay.<br/>I highly recommend this accomodation for the perfect location, kindness of landlords and especially for the delicious Justyna's homemade cakes!
->This flat is clean and new, within easy reach of shops and restaurants.
->Th house was very clean and tidy, Justyna and Grzegorz were perfect hosts, they gave us the privacy we needed and also made sure we had everything we need to make our stay was comfortable. The house was conveniently located near the station which has great connections to most of London. I would highly recommend this house.
->I was made to feel so welcome by both Justyna and Grzegorz and their home was an absolute credit to the pair of them; both the bedroom and bathroom were immaculate. It was also great to have a dedicated parking space and the location was well served regarding public transport with Ickenham tube station only being a 10 minute walk.
->Clean, warm, welcoming and perfectly located to travel and amenities. Strongly recommend.
->You will find an impeccably tidy and relaxed home, in a convenient location to amenities and pubs
->Great location just behind the station but also very quiet. Spotlessly clean apartment with lovely decor. Lovely hosts very accommodating, perfect for my visit.
->Justyna and Grzegorz were the perfect hosts. The house is modern, immaculately clean and provides access to a fully equipped kitchen. The room as well as private bathroom are spacious and pretty. The single most unique thing about this place is the fact how well it combines privacy and hospitality - whenever needed, I could feel like I am the only person in the house (that included kitchen!). On the other hand, if I needed help or just wanted to talk, the hosts were amazingly friendly and helpful. The fact that I initially booked for a week and extended to over 6 weeks is a good indicator of my experience. Can't recommend enough!
->Everything was flawless, exactly as during my previous stay with Justyna and Grzegorz. Strongly recommend.
