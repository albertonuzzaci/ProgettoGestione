->This is the perfect Airbnb. Easy to book, great communication from host and a place that exceeds expectations. We would stay again in a heartbeat. 
->Wonderful apartment. Great hosting. Everything I expected and more. Would definitely stay there again if I had he choice !
->Couldn't rate this apartment and lazer as a host highly enough! Will definitely stay again! Beautiful Veiws and a beautiful apartment.
->If you want a really clean, modern place to stay, with amazing views of the River Thames, then this is it! We really enjoyed our stay here! We consider it family friendly, although our kids are a bit older. It is very close to public transport and very secure.
->Fantastic flat, with stunning views and very close to the DLR (but not too close!). Lazer was a truly great host and checked regularly to  make sure everything was ok.
->This apartment was fantastic! It's new, clean and beautiful and is located on the Prime Meridian Line on the bank of the Thames River and across from the O2. Such a beautiful view! The closest DLR station is just a block away, as is a grocery store that had everything we needed. Lazer responded extremely quickly to any question or comment we had - before, during and after our stay. We'd love to stay here again!
->Made a great last minute holiday - the east end us like a whole new city we'd never explored and the apartment made all it really accessible. DLR so much nicer to use than the tube. The apartment gave us affordable luxury with the self catering we needed for a family. Lazer was always in the end of a phone so we didn't need to worry about s thing. The view and balcony was amazing. Big flat screen to great for the kids. Lots of fun.
->This apartment is in a fabulous location with great views of the Thames and a short walk from Canary Wharf.  The apartment was super clean and comfortable; not a cheap stay but worth it.
->Great place and location.
->The apartment was every bit as shown and described. New, clean and stylish with quality fittings.<br/>The views were spectacular ( especially from the balcony at night )  and the television offered multiple channels for a bit of relaxation at the end of the day.<br/>London is a big sprawling city ( compared to other European capitals ) so need to be mindful transportation is required for most sites, attractions and restaurants ) <br/>Communication with Lazer was excellent. This is very important when in a foreign country and a little unsure before settling in.  <br/>We very much enjoyed the apartment and would recommend to airbnb users.<br/>Dragan

->Great apartment and a great host, showed us everything in the flat when he let us in then was very happy for us to ring if we had any issues.
->A lovely place in a great location to get on and off the DLR so into the city. Plenty of room and set up with everything you may need for a short or longer stay. The beds were comfy and it was clean and tidy. We would definitely stay again in the future. Ali is very helpful and communication was fantastic. Thank you!
->Everything was perfectly clean and lovely. The location is stunning and was incredible for working in Canary Wharf (which I was). Check in was simple, the kitchen was gorgeous, the host was very kind and welcoming. Our stay was incredibly comfortable and everything with the location, cleanliness, ease, etc. really made it a lovely few nights
->Place is nice and area is great. Landlord communication wasn’t good, quite aggressive and didn’t really make us feel welcomed, more rushed. Amenities could be better, very little toilet roll.
->Host sounds intimidating at first, but actually a very lovely guy. He warmly welcomed us and showed us everything in the accommodation. I will definitely book his accommodation, whenever I’m in London.
->Great location!
->Good space and a great host , would definitely recommend to anyone staying in London
->The host was great and property was good value for money.
->Great location and nice space!!

->Host very helpful and great communication, apartment was easy to get into, very clean and was better than we expected 👍🏽
->A lovely clean and spacious place to stay in London
->Great space and great location!!! Walking distance to so many awesome sight seeing landmarks. Very close to a metro stop. And Amit was wonderful!!! Spacious and multiple bathrooms which was a huge plus!!!!
->Great apartment. Very clean and well thought out. Amit a brilliant host, very responsive and helpful.
->This is a beautiful flat in a great location, especially the proximity to Brick Lane. It is clean and well maintained with plenty of room for our 5 person group. We unfortunately had an experience with the power going out in the flat for about 9 daytime hours during our 2 day stay. Amit was able to have the power restored as quickly as what was within his control as it required an engineer to come and fix. We overall enjoyed our stay!
->I can only recommend the apartment and the host! 10/10.<br/>Super convenient check-in.<br/>Clean apartment. Everything was as described.<br/>Fast internet connection.<br/>Clear and exceptionally swift communication with the host. He was really helpful whenever we had a question.<br/>This was not a real problem for us, but the internet connection was a little bit unstable upstairs as the router is located downstairs. It did work upstairs too but video calls may be a bit laggy if you are in one of the bedrooms upstairs.<br/>All in all great experience. Thank you.
->Really clean and well presented apartment. It was spacious and welcoming. Amit was easy to get in touch with and checked up on us during our stay to make sure we was ok. It is a stones throw away from the tube station. Would recommend to others looking to stay and would happily stay again if the opportunity presented itself.
->Easy checkin, very clean, host was really flexible and kind to let us check in early

->Waren sehr zufrieden, ideal für Familien mit Kindern.
->Antoinette is an amazing host and the house is very spacious. I had my family of 4 staying there for over a month and it felt very comfortable and safe. The flat is very new and the beds were comfortable. The living room is ideal for a small family and the balcony is huge. The kitchen is fully equipped and had lots of pots and pans to use.<br/>There is no parking on site but they kindly gave me their parking spot which was 10-15 mins down the road. I was also offered cleaning services twice during our long stay at the place.<br/>The flat is easily accessible via tubes and buses.<br/>The hosts were very accommodating and was just a text away, that made it very safe and relaxing for us.<br/>Would highly recommend this place!

This made it easy to commute to and from the centre of the city. <br/>On our last day our flight wasn’t due to depart London until 8:30pm at night and again, Antoinette let us leave our luggage at the apartment all day so we could make the most of our last day.

->Clean and tidy. Good location
->Although this apartment is two floors above a street just off Brick Lane, it's really pretty quiet as Fashion Street itself is narrow with little traffic. The most we heard were the guys delivering food on bikes, who hang out next door in their breaks.<br/>We didn't like the fact that the main bathroom door doesn't fully close (though it's manageable. What we really DID appreciate was something that doesn't feature in the listing - the little outdoor seating area! The view's not great, but it was a lovely surprise to find it.<br/>We would probably go back on another trip to London.

->Carina and her Happyguest staff were awesome, thus honoring the goal and purpose embedded in their name. I had a wonderful experience along with my co-workers, who decided to come to London at the last minute for an off-site. Everything went smoothly, the location is fantastic, just a couple of minutes from the Aldgate East station, and the apartment was brand new and in pristine condition. I highly recommend Carina and the Happyguest team, and this particular flat. 
->Muy bien localizado, limpio y bien equipado, a solo una cuadra de estación del sub.
->We had a lovely stay. They went above and beyond to provide all amenities needed including toiletries and snacks. The space was beautiful and clean. Highly recommend. Thanks!
->Such a clean and lovely place for me and my family! The tube station is so near to the apartment, just a 1-2 minutes walk, making the transport to everywhere so convenient! There’s also a supermarket just beside the apartment. Overall we had a great stay and will highly recommend this place! :)
->Really nice flat, everything you need and more! Clean, taken care of, nicely furnished. The communication was great, Carina and her team responded really fast! Thanks again!
->HappyGuest knows how to host! They helped us find a place when our first Airbnb choice was taken. The apartment was clean, and new, and in a really hip neighborhood (with fun restaurants, bars, street art, etc). Near the Underground too, a great metro line that took us direct to all the major sites without changing trains. We enjoyed interacting with Andrei (our sitter) upon arrival. We appreciated the great communication (from before booking through the whole process).  The apartment was brand new, which of course meant there were some kinks to be worked out (a broken bathroom lock, for example) but by the time the next guest arrives I am sure the whole place will be ready to roll. I would recommend this apartment, or any HappyGuest propriety for that matter. 
->We had a wonderful time at this clean, modern & convenient flat. This was my first time using Airbnb and I'm very happy I did. My family of 5 had plenty of room to relax and unwind after long days spent exploring London. Phil & Carina were kind and accommodating.
->My family (two adults and two youngish children) really enjoyed are stay at this flat. Its location within a short walk from the Liverpool Street underground station made it great for our arrival via Stansted airport, and the close proximity to the Aldgate East station gave us good access to many of the sights around the city.<br/>The flat itself was very clean, with all necessities provided.<br/>One thing that we really appreciated was the quietness of the flat.  Even though the building itself is located on a fairly busy street, because the flat doesn't overlook the street but instead overlooks an inner garden area we were insulated from the street noise.<br/>Carina and the Happyguest team were also extremely accommodating with our late arrival and departure times. All of our communications with them were responded to politely and promptly.<br/>I would certainly recommend this flat to family/friends who visit London.
->Nice place！
->I would highly recommend this place. New, spotless and lose to all amenities and tube.

REVIEWS:

->I came to london with 2 to of my girlfriends to celebrate my birthday weekend. This flat is located in a lovely hood with lots of restaurants, coffee shops, bars. The apartment was clean and cozy, except it did have cigarette smell that was hard for us to digest. We left windows wide open when we were out to get the fresh air but it still didn't help. I hope the owner will be able to take care of this for future bookings. The owner is really helpful and communicated very well with us. The bedding was clean. I stayed on the pull out sofa, which wasn't the most comfortable to sleep on but it was fine for 3 nights (probably wouldn't be able to sleep for longer than that). The bathrooms and the kitchen were clean and had all necessary accessories for us (shampoo, soup, etc). Overall - we had a great time and I would recommend this place.
->The Host of this property was fantastic, from jumping on a facetime with me when I first arrived, to responding to each of my messages in minutes. We had a situation that needed his attention, and in the middle of Eid, he stepped about to help me. The place was clean and the attention to detail was awesome. I'd mentioned I was brining my kids and an Easter Egg was hidden so the girls could have an egg hunt when we arrived. I do think there is a smoker downstairs, which is unfortunate as we had to open  the windows when we returned to the apartment but aside from that, it was great, plenty of space, even for four, well stocked kitchen to cook in, close to transit and a bunch of great food places within walking distance. It was practical as I needed to be close to the city, but accessible for London adventures.
->Great location and comfortable apartment
->The host is very responsive and accommodating
->Clean, large apartment is the centre of Aldgate. Stayed here whilst on a business trip and had everything I needed. Very close to Aldgate East (5 mins) and a short walk (12 mins) to Liverpool St station. Only small comment would be that the apartment got a little hot during a London heatwave. It was absolutely fine with the windows open during the day, but too noisy to sleep with them open given proximity to the main road. A small fan would have been a welcome addition! Thanks for a great stay though. Would definitely stay again!
->A comfortable, welcoming, bright home with amenities that work well. The location is quite good, we were able to hit favorite spots along Brick Lane. The London Museum isn't too far away. Victoria Park... Burough Market.. The building has a lobby with an attendant on duty. The host makes you feel welcome from the start. and check in was easy.
->Good and nice apartment
->The apartment had a nice layout with two bedrooms and two bathrooms with a spacious lining area. The location isn’t in the nicest part of town.
->Very disappointed overall. Very old building and not so clean apartment, so much for 440£ per night.
->Nice and clean apartment quite close to Tower and Sky Garden. Hence, perfect for our stay. Thank you!

REVIEWS:

->What an amazing place to stay. The balcony is gigantic and you get the most awesome sweeping views of so much of London. The apartment itself is beautifully modern and Eleonora is an absolute credit to Airbnb - her communication is out of this world. Can't wait to come back.
->The flat itself is beautiful, the views of London are stunning. However, our check-in experience ruined the entire weekend for us. I was told to collect the keys from concierge by stating my name. Even though I did this, the man refused to give them to us because the previous guests had told him upon checking out and dropping off the keys, that the flat was an AirBnB. According to him, this (subletting) is against the building policy hence why he put the keys into the mailbox and reported the situation to the site manager that morning, and consequently refused us access when we tried to check-in at 4pm. I informed the host who at first accused me for stating to concierge that we were an AirBnB booking (which I didn’t), and then said she’d call concierge to resolve the situation (as she was out of the country) as what they were doing was not allowed. She could not resolve the situation with concierge, and instead, together with the help of her co-host, organised for someone to drop us off the keys. We had to wait for 2.5 hours (they arrived at 6:35pm), and were told 3 times that the person with they key would be 5 minutes when we followed up when in actual fact it was 40 minutes, 25 minutes, and 10 minutes respectively. Before checking in, we were told we had 1 free parking space in the car park and could pay for additional parking spaces - this would have to be sorted with concierge. Instead, we were sent to another concierge who refused us access to the car park as we were not residents, and we had to pay for parking spaces on the road. We asked for reassurance from the host, co-host and AirBnB that we’d have no issue over the weekend with concierge given what they’d previously said, and whilst they didn’t say anything to us, we were stared at intimidatingly when we walked past us - we didn’t feel welcome or comfortable. It was a bit unnerving given we were 6 girls, one of whom is pregnant. Whilst the host and co-host were very responsive when this all happened, and were able to send a friend to the flat the same evening to let us in, I would encourage them to organise a better check-in process for future guests and ensure concierge do not make their guests feel unwelcome.
->Exciting view from balcony!<br/>Very easy access to London city Centre.
->This was bt far the best experience I've ever had staying in London. <br/>The Apartment was spotless and kept to a very high standard.  The views of London made each evening as relaxing as being anywhere in the world. <br/>The comfort of the apartment made the trip feel more like a holiday than the Business trip it was.<br/>the host was very quick to communicate with me, the checknin process was as easy as walking into my own home. <br/>I would highly recommend this host and I can not wait for my next trip to London and hopefully being able to stay at this apartment again.
->A fantastic apartment- amazing value, clean, comfortable, spacious with outstanding views over London. Eleonora is a great host, responsive, helpful and very professional, a true credit to Airbnb! I will definitely be staying here again..
->The views from the patio were outstanding!! Could see all of the London skyline! Our family loved the time we spent in the flat. Having the doors open while eating dinner at the dining room table overlooking the city will be a memory we will keep forever. The closeness to the tube made going to different parts of the city so very accessible!
->this has to be one of the best air bnb I ever rented, the apartment is simply gorgeous, very spacious, clean, modern and comfortable,  the view is just breath-taking especially at night. contacting the host via the app was super wasy and fast. I will 100% recommend booking this listing
->Absolutely stunning place, the balcony is like something out of a Disney movie. Eleonora is an amazing host, always available with great communication!
->This apartment is modern and spacious with nice views on the river. The area feels secure and close to mini markets, local restaurants and coffee shops.<br/>The apartment contain 3 bedrooms which can practically sleep 4 adults. We were 5 so one had to sleep on the ground. Unfortunately the manager did not consider my request for a mattress. Kitchen area can be improved as well. Glasses and Mugs are insufficient. I also found dirty plastics in the cupboard.<br/>No iron so I bought my own, No coffee maker and no water boiler. The managers' execuse was safety. She suggested to use Dolce Gusto machine as waterboiler.<br/>The sofa was very dirty and stained.<br/>Overall very modern apartment but lack of attention to details.
->Lovely apartment.  Stunning view

->Awesome Apartment in an amazing location. Will be checking it's availability everytime I need a place to stay in London.
->Perfect communication. Well located. Great space!!
->A very nice Flat
->The location of this apartment is great for a stay in London and there is lots of bars etc very close by. The apartment is spacious and was ideal for a group of 8 for one night. We weren't pleased with there being a strong smell of sick in one of the bedrooms and some mould in the other bedroom and a few other things. However, I wouldn't not recommend staying here as they are things that could easily be sorted.
->The place is located in one of the many beautiful and artsy places in london. It is pretty close to everything if you uber, and has public transportation near by. When comes to the place, when we stayed one of the rooms was smelly and the problem was never solved. Then the showers were very inconsistent one day they worked the other they did not.
->A great, modern and clean apartment in a great location for exploring Shoreditch and the surrounding areas. Check-in was simple, communication between myself and the host was efficient and quick. Would definitely recommend and would stay again.
->A great place to stay in a great area, I would highly recommend. 
->Booked this for a pre-wedding get together for a group of friends: the location of the flat was amazing and perfect for a one night stay to access nearby nightlife and fun stuff nearby on each of the days. Living room sleeping was pretty noisy for those on the sofa beds but, to be fair, the listing did mention that! The separate bedrooms were great though and really nice shower/bathroom facilities. We didn't use the kitchen on this stay but there were decent looking facilities and a large table.
->The apartment is beautiful, very nice, clean and with views from the neighbourhood. I went with a group of students and they really loved the place and the location of the apartment. Really good! The check in and check out were easy and very simple. 
->Perfect for an affordable place to sleep at night, the beds were comfy. Hot tap in the en suite shower was broken which was a nuesance as there were 8 of us that wanted showers every night but the shower in the main bathroom that worked was lovely! <br/>There was already an array of essentials in the kitchen, coffee tea sugar jam salt spices etc. <br/>The washing machine door was broken so we couldn't use it but there is a dishwasher which saved us doing the washing up!!<br/>All in all, it was a pleasant stay :-)

->Appartement équipé, fonctionnel et calme, on s'y sent tout de suite comme à la maison! Très bien situé à pied, en métro ou bus.
->Fabulous
->Myself & a work colleague stayed at Amit’s apartment for a one night business trip - it is brilliantly situated for the City & is just a few hundred metres from Aldgate East tube station. Amit was a brilliant host, providing great communication & thorough & helpful instructions. The apartment is spacious & spotlessly clean. It is stylish with nice touches that set it apart from some of the more ‘bland’ places & it was very easy to feel at home. The two bathrooms meant that myself & my colleague had our own spaces and privacy. There were toiletries in the bathroom cabinets, which was fantastic as I forgot my shower gel! I would definitely recommend staying here, the rooms are genuine doubles so the apartment could easily accommodate 6. I will almost certainly stay again!
->Beautiful, clean apartment, host is very quick to respond and thoughtful, great location with links to London literally minutes away. Perfect experience.
->Amit and his flat were amazing. The location is wonderful and the space was fresh and clean. Beds were comfortable with lots of room. Even before we arrived he was clear and communicated well and quickly. More than anything, he was so accommodating to our travels. We are so thankful and regret not staying with him in Whitechapel longer!

->A kind and welcoming host. The apartment is clean spacious and makes you feel that you are at home. I enjoyed having a fresh brew of coffee when I wanted. Highly recommend the place.
->Rustam is an excellent host. He made my stay so pleasant and easy. He organised parking, answered every query I had and handled everything so smoothly. The apartment is amazing- the location is great too- very easy to get in to central London and the Thames is a short walk away. I'll definitely be rebooking whenever I am visiting London.
->Overall great, matched listing.  Fast internet.
->Rustam is an excellent host, very friendly and considerate. We had a great time in his flat (2 adults, 2 kids), which is in a fantastic location, very central — we really recommend this place to explore London by river boat as it is just a short walk from Canary Wharf pier. The kitchen is perfectly equipped and Rustam has stocked it with all the essentials and more. The flat is all in all very comfortable and convenient for both short and longer stays. We hope to be able to stay at Rustam’s again soon!
->One of my bet AirBnB experiences so far. Location is perfect for exploring London. Facilities and kitchen all well-stocked. Host was helpful and communicated well. Highly recommended, would stay again.
->Nice, well maintained, large apartment with two bedrooms and two bedrooms.

REVIEWS:

->We rented the flat for four days and found the accommodation excellent in terms of location, facilities and views over the Thames. The view to Canary wharf really made our stay given we were limited to staying in each night with a ten month old. The secure parking was also a massive plus given the volume of stuff babies need required us to travel by car. This was our first time using air BnB and have come away with a really positive view of the service based on our experience staying in this flat
->This was a great place for me enjoyed it
->Great place to stay with my wife and in-laws. Close to Wapping station, a great deli, good pub and restaurants. Incredible views of the river. A perfect base to explore the city
->The house is beautifully decorated and comfortable.  Location was good next to Thames river but through tube station was 10 min away and needed 2 more tube to get to the main attraction.<br/>The house was clean and we'll aquiped. <br/>The thing that bothered us the most is the treasure hunt we had to do to get/drop the house key. That's the last thing anyone  want to do at 5am. Comunication with the management was poor. Took them 18 hours to respond to a problem and not to our satisfaction. 
->What a fantastic apartment in an interesting, little-visited part of London. The views and layout are superb and the apartment is warm, clean and quiet. We will be back.
->Sue is a very nice host, her flat is fashionable, clean and convenient, don’t hesitate to book it!
->Très bel appartement avec une vue exceptionnelle<br/>Très confortable<br/>Literie super<br/>2 salle de bain<br/>Manque de la vaisselle en cuisine<br/>Attention pas de cafetière
->Il mio soggiorno è stato a dir poco meraviglioso. <br/>Posto splendido, location tranquilla lontana dal traffico ma al tempo stesso DENTRO IL CUORE DI LONDRA, quella vera. Vicino a tutto ed a tutti i servizi più importanti (trasporti, supermercati, attrazioni).... elegantissima ed appoggiata sul Tamigi, di cui la sera e la mattina si sente il leggero rumore...<br/>DAlle finestre sul fiume SKYLINE DA URLO...... insomma, sto già riprenotando!
->i was visiting the UK to spend time with my daughters who live in North and South of England, Sue's place proved to be the very best choice of a central meeting place for a few days of exploring London. <br/>on entering the home it took my breath away as to the immediate uninterrupted view of the Thames and the city skyline... the words and photos on the promotional side simply do not prepare you for the incredible sights and sounds.<br/>in terms of comfort and amenities we could find nothing lacking, superbly comfortable and open spaces, for 4 adults and my little Grandchild we had plenty room.<br/>an easy walk to train / tube / bus routes and a stroll to St Katherine's wharf from where we took a boat ride to Westminster... Canary wharf in the opposite direction and hop on hop off tube rides to all the main touristy sights of London. fantastic.<br/>just next door is a tremendous historical pub for a relaxed meal and a beer overlooking the river.<br/>a memorable trip indeed and I highly recommend Sue's place. if we ever get the opportunity we will definitely be back.
->Sue's flat is lovely, spacious, & furnished with taste, & the view from the living room is magnificent, especially when the sun comes in in the morning, but even on a foggy day. You can enjoy it like a home, as it leaves you free to impose your own style on it. The only disadvantages I can see is the distance from grocery shopping, but if you want to stock up, the bus will take you to a Waitrose supermarket in 10 minutes, no problem. The flat could use a coffee-maker & a few other necessities for making meals, but perhaps by now it has them!

->This is a great Air BnB!<br/>Our best yet, a beautiful apartment with everything we needed, a very comfortable stay in a great location. The host was really helpful & just on the other end of the phone if we had any issues. We will certainly book this place again when next in London. 
->The host was really precise and accurate, he wrote down all the instructions on a practical PDF document. <br/>The flat position was perfect because it was easy to reach the main tube and bus stations from there and also Tower bridge was very near, only 15 minutes walking. The place was clean, cosy and warm, very nicely furnished. <br/>We enjoyed our stay. Thanks Daniel :)<br/><br/>
->Daniel is a great host. Very responsive and always happy to help. He also gave us lots of good tips for things to do and places to go in the neighborhood. The flat is gorgeous and perfectly situated. I definitely would recommend staying there!
->Simply perfect. Every single thing was better than I had hoped for when I booked this loft apartment for my girlfriend and her family. Daniel was a great host, we never met him but he was always available if I had any questions. The apartment is situated in a perfect location, 5 minutes from the tube and the area is quiet.   The rooms and bedrooms are very very comfortable and it's a great place to relax in the evening after a long day sight seeing.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this apartment for anyone who wants to spend time with there family in London.<br/><br/>Thank you Daniel for allowing us to enjoy your home!  It was the perfect weekend in the right apartment.<br/>
->We really enjoyed our stay in Daniel's flat. All communication prior to stay was great, quick responses from Daniel to my questions and the guide he provided had relevant information 're tube stations etc that we needed. The location was very good, only 15 minutes walk to Tower Bridge and 5 minutes walk to the tube station. <br/>The flat was very clean when we arrived, with good quality bed linen. I'm being picky when I say I would have liked a few more towels.  Although nothing to do with Daniel, we were disturbed by the noise of several young men talking whilst standing outside one of the flats opposite until 1am on our last night.<br/>Would we stay here again? Absolutely!<br/>Thank you Daniel.
->Myself and my family visited (5 people in our group) Daniels apartment/flat last weekend. From the very first interaction with Daniel we found him very easy to deal with and very pleasant. He gave us some great tips in terms of where to eat and the suggestions he included on the property page were so helpful. We were actually blown away by how beautiful the flat was. It was very clean and had everything included that you would need for your trip. The flat is conveniently located near to the tube station for easy access to all the attractions London has to offer. We certainly felt like we were in a home away from home and will be recommending this property to all our friends and family who are visiting London. We'll definitely be back again soon! 
->客厅非常大，光线充足，离伦敦塔很近
->Very welcoming  Daniel is a great communicator and access was easy comfortable beds great location
->Daniel's flat is as gorgeous as it seems in the photos. There was definitely more than enough room for our group of four, two tidy bathrooms and the most comfortable beds ever. Everything went smoothly - the check-in was made really easy for us. The location is great too, with a relatively short walk to the nearest underground station. I definitely highly recommend Daniel's apartment!
->wow wow wow!<br/><br/>Do not hesitate to stay at this amazing place!<br/><br/>We had such a great time here. Daniel is the most perfect host, great communication through out the stay. The place is furnished beautifully and a 10 min walk to to Aldgate east station. thank you to Daniel for making us feel so welcome :)<br/><br/>

REVIEWS:

->The accommodation check in process was easy, and the location was great (10/10). Unfortunately the accommodation itself was not that good. The entrance to the accommodation looks you’re entering the slums of Mumbai. Once inside, the living room was of a nice standard but wasn’t clean, with stains and dust everywhere. The TV also wasn’t working. Only one shower out of the two was working, and both showers were actually dirty and were blocked. The one shower that worked would cut the hot water off after 2 minutes use (I suspect because the owner wants to limit how much hot water we use!) The biggest issue we had was two people in the party didn’t have any duvets for sleeping because we couldn’t find the linens for the sofa beds, and so had to use the towels as blankets! (Turns out the owner keeps the linens hidden somewhere in the sofa and claims he explains where these are in an ‘apartment guide’ that we weren’t told about and I don’t think exists!). <br/>Overall, for the amount we spent the accommodation was ok, but be prepared for most things not to work or for things to be dirty.
->The Host Was, Amazing
->Clean and well furnished apartment <br/>Good communication from host
->Blinds broken in bedroom letting light in. Tv doesn’t work due to bad signal. Shower in en suite cold. Toilet seat in en suite broken. Good communication and check in details from host

->Great location and value for money, some small issues with one shower not turning on but apart from that great! Would stay again :)
->Host has disappointing behaviour and poor response time
->We enjoyed our stay, lovely little apartment with a spacious living room. Great location and good value for money. Parking very close which was reasonably priced too.
->nice clean spacious apartment right in the middle of Shoreditch.  Good find, thanks!
->This apartment was just what we needed (essentially a crash pad for four of us after a night out in Shoreditch) - great location, plenty big enough for us, comfy beds and two bathrooms. Check-in procedure and communication was very good.
