REVIEWS:

->Great location & host
->Great apartment at a top location
->Great roomy apartment, lovely and clean. Great location with loads to do locally. If you are looking for a quiet apartment this might not be for you as on Saturday night it was quite noisy into the small hours, closing the windows did block out a lot of the noise though. 
->This is a great location and starting point for your stay in London.  The flat is well kept with responsive hosts and everything you need to enjoy work or play in London.
->Location very good close to the Main Street and bars/pubs. Apartment a bit worse for wear. Just needs a bit of TLC. Wardrobe wonky and looks like it’s going to fall on you , walls stained, toilet flusher not working, floors shredded and shower stained. Host did not reply to my message on the day but easy to pick up the key and staff in bell boi are friendly and answer all your questions. Overall, everything ran smoothly but I would not stay here if you are looking for a quiet nights sleep as it’s outside a bar on the Main Street and very loud even if the windows are closed (this was stated in the description) . Despite all the minor problems I would still stay here again as it’s good value for money and still modern and perfect for what I booked for. 
->Notre séjour s'est bien déroulé.<br/>Le quartier est vivant mais nous étions prévenus.<br/>Nous recommandons ce logement.
->It was a great place in London, especially for Young people
->Great Location and space, couldn't have asked for anything more!
->The accommodation was exactly as we expected, a great space for a group of 8 of us. The kitchen was well equipped for its size and did us well. The sofa beds and beds were comfy and easy to make up. <br/>The area is super noisy so take ear plugs if you want to sleep soundly. <br/>The apartment is in an awesome area, jammed packed full of bars, restaurants and interesting people! <br/>Great value for a night in London!
->Me and my co-workers had a great stay in the apartment. The location is perfect. We stayed with 4 people in the apartment and had enough space and beds for each. The communication was great! Would happily suggest this place to everyone coming to London for work or leisure.

->Very nice location!!!!
->Clean and tidy. Good location
->Although this apartment is two floors above a street just off Brick Lane, it's really pretty quiet as Fashion Street itself is narrow with little traffic. The most we heard were the guys delivering food on bikes, who hang out next door in their breaks.<br/>We didn't like the fact that the main bathroom door doesn't fully close (though it's manageable. What we really DID appreciate was something that doesn't feature in the listing - the little outdoor seating area! The view's not great, but it was a lovely surprise to find it.<br/>We would probably go back on another trip to London.

->Awesome Apartment in an amazing location. Will be checking it's availability everytime I need a place to stay in London.
->Perfect communication. Well located. Great space!!
->A very nice Flat
->The location of this apartment is great for a stay in London and there is lots of bars etc very close by. The apartment is spacious and was ideal for a group of 8 for one night. We weren't pleased with there being a strong smell of sick in one of the bedrooms and some mould in the other bedroom and a few other things. However, I wouldn't not recommend staying here as they are things that could easily be sorted.
->The place is located in one of the many beautiful and artsy places in london. It is pretty close to everything if you uber, and has public transportation near by. When comes to the place, when we stayed one of the rooms was smelly and the problem was never solved. Then the showers were very inconsistent one day they worked the other they did not.
->A great, modern and clean apartment in a great location for exploring Shoreditch and the surrounding areas. Check-in was simple, communication between myself and the host was efficient and quick. Would definitely recommend and would stay again.
->A great place to stay in a great area, I would highly recommend. 
->Booked this for a pre-wedding get together for a group of friends: the location of the flat was amazing and perfect for a one night stay to access nearby nightlife and fun stuff nearby on each of the days. Living room sleeping was pretty noisy for those on the sofa beds but, to be fair, the listing did mention that! The separate bedrooms were great though and really nice shower/bathroom facilities. We didn't use the kitchen on this stay but there were decent looking facilities and a large table.
->The apartment is beautiful, very nice, clean and with views from the neighbourhood. I went with a group of students and they really loved the place and the location of the apartment. Really good! The check in and check out were easy and very simple. 
->Perfect for an affordable place to sleep at night, the beds were comfy. Hot tap in the en suite shower was broken which was a nuesance as there were 8 of us that wanted showers every night but the shower in the main bathroom that worked was lovely! <br/>There was already an array of essentials in the kitchen, coffee tea sugar jam salt spices etc. <br/>The washing machine door was broken so we couldn't use it but there is a dishwasher which saved us doing the washing up!!<br/>All in all, it was a pleasant stay :-)

->John's place was wonderful, closer than we expected it to be, to what we need. Extremely comfortable, and well decorated,  we would have stayed longer if the place was still available 
->This is the first time we've used airbnb and I can't see how it could of been a better experience, about 5 minutes after registering I was talking to John on the phone, with all the details done and dusted. I felt like I was chatting with a long lost brother! John met us at the flat which was absolutely as advertised if not better,it was warm and comfortable with an easy walk to DLR and Westfield shopping centre. The flat had everything you could need including secure private parking, there were lovely views across the canal and the Olympic park. There's lots of stylish glass walls in kitchen/siting room area, so the only thing I would bring next time is my dressing gown so that I don't frighten any canal walkers whilst making tea first thing in the morning.
->Great host. Great place. Highly recommendable.

There was a problem in the heater we had cold showers  ..<br/>The cleaner(Sevetlana) came in to the flat with out a permition when we were out .. Then John send me a long message saying Sevetlana didn't found the bins while it was in the other room and there was a broken chair in the main room and I said it was already broken when we arrived .. I didn't like the way of checking . After a week from the check out John send me a bill to pay for a blocked sink that I don't know any thing about it . 
->We stayed at John's fabulous flat for my daughter's birthday with 4 of her friends. We had an amazing time - the flat is fantastic, really luxurious, spotlessly clean, lovely décor - the pictures do not do justice! John was a great host, really quick to respond and very helpful, even organising a taxi for us with a singing cabbie! Thanks for a great stay, we'll be back!

->Myself & a work colleague stayed at Amit’s apartment for a one night business trip - it is brilliantly situated for the City & is just a few hundred metres from Aldgate East tube station. Amit was a brilliant host, providing great communication & thorough & helpful instructions. The apartment is spacious & spotlessly clean. It is stylish with nice touches that set it apart from some of the more ‘bland’ places & it was very easy to feel at home. The two bathrooms meant that myself & my colleague had our own spaces and privacy. There were toiletries in the bathroom cabinets, which was fantastic as I forgot my shower gel! I would definitely recommend staying here, the rooms are genuine doubles so the apartment could easily accommodate 6. I will almost certainly stay again!

REVIEWS:

->The accommodation check in process was easy, and the location was great (10/10). Unfortunately the accommodation itself was not that good. The entrance to the accommodation looks you’re entering the slums of Mumbai. Once inside, the living room was of a nice standard but wasn’t clean, with stains and dust everywhere. The TV also wasn’t working. Only one shower out of the two was working, and both showers were actually dirty and were blocked. The one shower that worked would cut the hot water off after 2 minutes use (I suspect because the owner wants to limit how much hot water we use!) The biggest issue we had was two people in the party didn’t have any duvets for sleeping because we couldn’t find the linens for the sofa beds, and so had to use the towels as blankets! (Turns out the owner keeps the linens hidden somewhere in the sofa and claims he explains where these are in an ‘apartment guide’ that we weren’t told about and I don’t think exists!). <br/>Overall, for the amount we spent the accommodation was ok, but be prepared for most things not to work or for things to be dirty.
->The Host Was, Amazing
->Clean and well furnished apartment <br/>Good communication from host
->Blinds broken in bedroom letting light in. Tv doesn’t work due to bad signal. Shower in en suite cold. Toilet seat in en suite broken. Good communication and check in details from host
->shops, food, drinks local
->Great location and value for money, some small issues with one shower not turning on but apart from that great! Would stay again :)
->Host has disappointing behaviour and poor response time
->We enjoyed our stay, lovely little apartment with a spacious living room. Great location and good value for money. Parking very close which was reasonably priced too.
->nice clean spacious apartment right in the middle of Shoreditch.  Good find, thanks!
->This apartment was just what we needed (essentially a crash pad for four of us after a night out in Shoreditch) - great location, plenty big enough for us, comfy beds and two bathrooms. Check-in procedure and communication was very good.

->Recently enjoyed a great stay in John's lovely flat. From the beginning, communication was frequent with plenty of info.

->Muy agradable en una zona fenomenal de Londres
->Great location for our girls weekend, with loads of brilliant bars and restaurants on the doorstep. Check-in was very smooth. <br/>We were somewhat disappointed that there weren’t proper curtains in any of the rooms, which impacted the quality of sleep. The dishwasher also seemed to be permanently out of order. <br/>We also struggled with the welcome book and were a little confused as this appeared to be in the name of a completely different couple?!
->place was great, convenient location and everything was as expected
->Great location, clean and good value. A little loud but to be expected as an on street location
->Perfect location and excellent apartment , definitely stay here again
->This is the second time I have stayed at one of Hayley’s homes. Her homes are always of good standard (as the picture shows), great locations and Hayley is a great host! Will be booking again in the future!
->Clean and very nice apartment. A bit noisy due to the 1st floor in the centre of Shoreditch, but perfect to get anywhere. We stayed very well.
->Great place to stay
->Great flat, spacious, sofa beds very easy to make, good amenities and very clean.
->Great minimal space located next to a very vibrant district, highly recommended for short trips.

->Great location good value communication with host very good would recommend
->Really lovely place in great location.
->It’s a nice experience of living in the flat. There is a good location to take public transport and shopping.
->Pros: Easy check-in, the host is very responsive. Very convenient to have a washer and dryer inside the room. Very close to some supermarkets and restaurants. <br/>Cons: The apartment itself is not very modern or new, some furniture need repairing.  Need to exchange some light bulbs. The area is not so great but close to bus stops.
->Many halal places to eat nearby as the population nearby is mostly of Bangladesh people. Many sweet shops and street vendors near by on the busy white chapel road. The Whitechapel and Aldgate/Aldgate East tube stations are a decent 15-20min walk. Bus stops close by on Commercial Road was convenient and McDonalds 24h nearby too. Unit was average clean. Sofa beds more comfortable than the spring mattress beds. Elevator was a plus!

->The apartment was close to the tube station which made travelling around London easy. There was a lift which was extremely appreciated as we had a lot of luggage.

->We were a group of four and spent three nights. The flat is close to Whitechapel Station. The rooms are a bit small but the flat is fully equipped. The beds are very comfy! It was clean and we felt cozy. There is even a small balcony. The only drawback was that I had to collect the keys in a different place and lost some time therefore. All in all we had a pleasant stay!
