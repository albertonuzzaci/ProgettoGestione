Cemile is very sweet and easy to get on with! She definitely goes out of her way to make sure you're having a comfortable stay. The location is perfect for tourists looking to go around London. And it's also close to the underground and bus station. I would stay here again.
Cemile is a very sincere girl with a very personal character, the house is very warm and cosy. And the dog is also very cute. The house is very suitable for people who travel to London.
everything was really good!
Cemile is a great host who is very respectful to your stay in the shared property. Louie the dog made my stay much more welcoming by coming to say hello to me each day! The location of the flat is in perfect walking distance of all public transport links and is easy to find. <br/>The price was fantastic for my week stay, especially for London! <br/>The only downside was lack of freezer space so I was limited when it came to preparing and keeping food. <br/>Thanks again Cemile
Cosy and clean.
Lovely bedroom space. Gets a wee bit hot on hot summer nights, but not too bad. Host is a lovely, good-hearted lady with a very sweet doggie.
Kind host, cute dog, great location, nice energy.<br/>P.s. don't fear the foxes. They are easy-going and mind their own business.
Nice space and in a great location. There's a Tesco nearby and another food shop just below the flat...it was quiet, and warm and overall cozy and welcoming. The room is pretty big and perfect for 2 people. Cemille is a great host, very nice and welcoming, she made me a cup of tea when she came home, and made sure we had everything we needed.
Great location <br/>Cemile is a very friendly host <br/>Easy to get along and easy to talk to <br/>Love her dog Louie too!
This is such a great location to visit central London. It's a 15 - 20 minute walk to the underground and rail services. Very comfortable accommodation. Great neighborhood. Jem (spelling?) is wonderful and her dog, Louis, is a sweetie.

  description: We are offering a bright and comfortable double spare bedroom in a 1970s town house on a well designed estate in Nunhead. Modernist in feel. I have a ten year old son Morgan and a large labradoodle dog Albie.  We are looking to rent to someone who is ok with children and a very friendly if slightly exciteable dog. The room looks over a quiet tree lined road, hence Limes walk.<br />The house has lots of light with skylights and sliding doors the full width of the house onto a balcony.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />You would be sharing the bathroom and kitchen with us.<br />There is a library of books in the room which you would be welcome to use.

--------------------
Expect to have a peaceful and great place to stay. Hatty and Morgan are super friendly and I felt like being home. I was quite busy so not around too much but in the evening it was great to come back here and have a chat with Hatty and then go to bed.
I spent a quite good time in Hatty’s home, the dog is very outgoing also Hatty and Morgan are friendly and welcome. The journey is busy because we went to the firework so we come back very late, I hope we were not disturbing you. The house is cozy and beautiful also the transport is very convenient. Extremely recommend for all you guys who visit London.
I stayed at Hatty’s for nearly two weeks between a move. The house is a great space - very stylish and arty. The bedroom is sizeable and has a fridge and a kettle included. There is an absolutely giant bath which was an added bonus!<br/>Potential lodgers should bear in mind that this is a proper family home with a relaxed vibe. The room is next door to Hatty’s son and you will be escorted up and down the stairs by a very lovable dog. <br/>Hatty went above and beyond for me during my stay so I consider her hosting to be exceptional.
Hatty has a great artsy vibe house in beautiful Nunhead. I booked her room for a 2-week stay for my mother who was visiting family in the area. Despite my mom not speaking any English, she felt comfy in Hatty's place. Big raving reviews for the dog as well! Despite never meeting Hatty in person, I had a great interaction with her online. I would happily use her place again in the future.
Hatty's place is really nice and homely, with a friendly dog Albi who loves to hang out with you and follows you around from time to time. Room was bright and spacious, fast internet and comes with a desk. Really useful since I work from my laptop during the day. I spent a great week there. Would definitely stay there again when I come back to London.
Hatty’s family is super friendly. I had great conversations with her talking about arts and politics. Morgan is a quiet and polite boy and Albie the dog is very welcoming.<br/>There’re many modern artworks throughout the flat. The bedroom has a relaxing view and lots of books to read, all are of good taste. The bed is comfortable and clear, every morning I woke up feeling refreshed.<br/>Prefect for who likes a home-like vibe, and wants some very local tips.
Everything was as expected.  Thanks a lot Hatty.
Funky townhouse in quiet area of Nunhead. Bright, airy room with comfortable bed. Parking right outside, which I liked. Dog will proudly present you with a shoe, so pretend to be impressed to avoid hurting his feelings. Would definitely stay again. Recommended.
Hatty's double bedroom is a perfect sized room with everything you could ever need. Hatty and Morgan were so welcoming and they have a lovely dog Albie, who has lots of energy and is very friendly. There is loads of amazing art around the house and she has a great sized kitchen/living room area that you can easily spend time in relaxing. Overall one of the best stays I have ever had and would happily stay again!
I enjoyed my stay at Hattys home, she responds very quick. Hatty was very helpful. Her son and dog very respectful. I enjoyed my stay.

A lovely and stylish space with a note and chocolates left out which was a very nice touch. We would stay here again!
We stayed here for 1 night (2 adults & 2 teens) as we were going to a family birthday nearby. It was perfect for us - very good communication from Nikki, good value & everything as described.
Casa accogliente e ordinata. <br/>15 minuti a piedi dalla metro.
A lovely house (bright, clean and comfortable) in a great location. Amazing value for money in London and Nikki is a very responsive and helpful host - we had a brilliant stay!
Lovely welcoming family home - thank you so much for hosting my family this Christmas!
Well positioned , likely to book here again when in this area.
perfect house for us to stay with our two young boys. like a home from home with everything we could need
Perfect for what we needed, close to tube station and bus stops, little shop a few mins walk away and a quiet street. Nikki was fast at replying to any questions and flexible with check in and out.
Nikki's house is in a great location and communication with Nikki was great. She's very quick to reply. <br/>The house feels very homey. It may have been useful to have some information on good local restaurants or things to do.
Lovely host! 100% recommend

It has been a very cozy stay. Very clean, tidy and quiet house. Eli has been close and very detailed.  I really appreciate her interest and hospitality.
La casa è più grande di quanto sembri nelle foto.<br/>All’arrivo, la host, Eli vi fornirà tutti gli accessori necessari (asciugamani-coperte-pantofole etc) e farà un tour della casa.<br/>Eli è una persona simpatica, aperta e molto d’aiuto.<br/>Ha un cane che è intelligente e non è invasivo, se amate i cani BENE sennò evitatelo.<br/>Se vi offre mai del cibo, accettate! Eli è una cuoca straordinaria, in generale una buona persona e che rispetta la privacy.<br/>Tenete pulito il vostro ambiente.
Staying at Eli's was a pleasure,  the best airbnb that could be ever. Eli had thought of everything to make your stay comfortable. The street is quiet, but public transport and shops are in walking distance. The sweet dog was a lovely addition. Moreover, she was so kind that drop me of and pick me up on the London strike day!I would definitely come back.
The flat and area is lovely, bed very comfortable, host is extremely nice. Dog is very cute!
えりさんのお家はとても素敵で綺麗で、お部屋も広く毎日快適に過ごさせていただきました。<br/>美味しい日本食もありがとうございました！<br/>ロンドンで困ったことがあった時は、色々な情報を教えてくださり、滞在中は本当にお世話になりました。<br/>犬のももちゃんも、とっても賢くて可愛くて一緒に滞在ができて楽しかったです！<br/>ありがとうございました。
I totally like Eli's personally! She helped me a lot of things how London is . <br/>The room is big , the bed is comfortable . I cloud sleep well and remove tiredness . Moreover the dog makes me feel better ! <br/>The location to station and grocery stores are nice and close .<br/>That was the best stay ever .
Eli provides so warm welcome and amazing comfort in her home. Her great dog that is forever in my heart.  The room is warm and cosy, the bed is  very comfortable , the lighting is great. She has a garden which is very good. I strongly recommend Eli,s accommodation.
I stayed at Eli's home for a few nights while work in London. Eli is a welcoming host, and she always checks and answers her messages quickly. The room was tidy, clean and spacious. Great location close to train station and bus stop. I love her amazing dog and lovely garden. I would certainly recommend Eli's to anyone looking for accommodation in London, it's 15 min by train to London Bridge.
I had a fantastic stay with Eli in her clean, comfortable and warm flat in south London just 5 minutes walk to Lee train station with direct links to Charing Cross Station.  Eli is a fantastic host, a genuinely kind and caring person who made me feel very welcome during my stay.  The bedroom was lovely and spacious, perfect temperature and very quiet too.  I slept well in a comfy clean bed, could not ask for more really! I was provided with towel, wash cloth and use of the super clean and well appointed bathroom.  Whilst I didn’t need to cook or prepare any food during my stay, I had access to the kitchen and was able to store my food in the fridge.  All in all I had a 5 star stay and look forward to staying with Eli (and her cute intelligent dog) again in the future!
Lovely home in a quiet neighborhood, close to train station and buses. Cafés and minimarket in walking distance. Eli and Momo were lovely housemates!

AMazing hosts, treat me like family and gave me advice on my current situation! Not a bother at all! These are the best hosts ever! They deserve more than 5 stars!!!!!!!! Thank you so much!!!
Great location if you are looking for accommodation around Heathrow. Great hospitality and communication from Ria. She was very helpful in answering any questions I had and made the whole process very easy. I felt that she genuinely cared and did everything possible to make my stay a very pleasant one. I will definitely be booking Ria’s  place again, if it's available, should I need to stay overnight in London in the future. The room n house was superclean, the room and house had all the amenities which one can think of. the place is a family home so one needs to follow house rules given by Ria. There is one supercute dog Enzo who is superfriendly and always in mood for playing. All in all, i loved the place and had an awesome time in the apartment.
Super clean and large kitchen. Ria give us lots of useful information. <br/>Overall friendly and welcome, enjoyable stay.

Amanda and Stephen helped me to feel very welcome from the start, just like being part of the family.  It was great fun with Rex and Napoleon, their dog and puppy, too!  They were both knowledgeable about the local area and incredibly good hosts, being naturally sociable and providing all that I needed to make my stay enjoyable.  <br/>There was a generous amount of fridge space available, which I really appreciated.  Also good storage space in the bedroom. <br/>I look forward to staying with them again when I'm in the area!
Thank you Amanda and Chef Steve for a most heart welcoming and enjoyable stay at their home. What a wonderful experience: warm comfortable home, I felt like I was at home away from home, excellent value for money, and wait for it - the most beautiful garden that lights up at night. The bad ..... No fault of their own - Just couldn't extend my stay for a third time due to being fully booked till August!  No wonder why......
Amanda and Stephen were warm, helpful hosts and the household, just as described, was relaxed and friendly.  The neighbourhood was quiet, pleasant and convenient.  I would definitely stay again.
Amanda was an excellent host. I arrived very late and she accommodated me very generously giving me good directions. The room is quite cozy and it was everything I needed for my short stay. I even had my own bathroom for most of the time. The house is clean and well equipped. The neighborhood is very quiet, safe, and convenient to the tube. Nice central location for both Heathrow and Gatwick and getting to city center. This was perfect for a single woman traveling alone. I feel lucky to have found this place and highly recommend!
Amanda and Stephen are the best. The room is small but comfortable. The house is clean and has everything you need. The location is perfect. Safe neighbourhood, supermarkets and tubes around the corner, close to London and very convenient for wimbledon tennis. I highly recommend this place and would love to come back. The dogs stole my heart!
Amanda & Stephen are very lovely hosts and will help you with anything you need. The room is cozy and the bed is comfortable. I'm really grateful that they were able to accommodate us for our Wimbledon adventure. Their dogs are really sweet too. I would stay here again & I would highly recommend this place to others. 
Amanda and Stephen were lovely, amazing hosts! They were friendly, helpful and very welcoming. They made sure I had everything I needed and were willing to help and give advice if needed. The atmosphere in the house was indeed friendly and I felt very safe and relaxed. The room and the house in general was tidy and well equipped. The Southfields tube station is really close and there are also some shops and nice places to eat at the station. The dogs were really cute, especially little Napoleon! If I need a place to stay again in London Amanda's and Stephen's place would be my first choice. Thank you so very much!
I only stayed for a couple of nights whilst working in London. Amanda and her partner were really friendly and welcoming. I was able to store my bike in their garden and that was really handy for me. The bed was comfortable and everything was as expected. Their dogs are adorable & I'd defintiely recommend staying here.
Both Amanda and Stephen were great hosts. The house and room are very clean. It has everything you need. The dogs are very sweet.<br/>Amanda and Stephen could help me with any questions I had.
Mi sono trovata molto bene, casa molto pulita e ordinata, la famiglia molto accogliente e disponibile per qualsiasi cosa!<br/>Simpatici e ospitali.<br/>La casa era a esattamente 7 minuti dalla metro e la fermata del bus era molto vicina.<br/>Il quartiere era ben abitato, pulito e signorile.<br/>Tornerei domani, sicura al 100%.

Her place is beautifully decorated and very clean. Location was perfect for my purposes. I would highly recommend staying with Kim. 
Beautiful home filled with love in a charming part of London !<br/>The area is surprising - beautiful ! with loads of green, water canal and shops - everything you need is around the corner and the transport is a few min walks ... <br/>The house is warm as Kim is a beautiful host who would make you feel at home straight away :)<br/>The room is very cosy, the kitchen fully equipped and the garden is awesome. <br/>Last but not least, Dora & Matilda "the puppies" are a real delight and very friendly ... <br/>I would def. come back as I had a great experience in Kim's loving home. 
A great welcome to a good modern homely flat, with friendly dogs.
Kim's house is a brilliant place to stay. The dogs are just great, I would love to have stayed longer. Oh and Kim is a really kind, relaxed host that makes your stay feel more like visiting a friend. Thanks for letting me in so early on the first day!!
Clean and Spacious room located within walking distance from underground station. Great for travellers exploring the city by public transport. Kim is a very friendly host, she gave me plenty of advices on places to go and transport in london. I had a change of travel plans and she was kind to refund me the fees for one night. The dogs are adorable too :) 
Kim is very nice, friendly and easy to communicate with. I enjoyed staying at Kim's place with the lovely two dogs. If you're a solo traveler, Kim's place would be ideal. It's not very close to the central part of London but still 20min distance by the tube. You know it's almost impossible to have a private space in the center at this price.
Perfect communication, very tidy house and reasonable price for the location.
I stayed with Kim and her 2 amazing dogs for almost 3 weeks while I got set up in London. Kim is really friendly and helpful. She gave me lots of great advice about London that really made my move a lot easier. <br/>The house is lovely....always really tidy and has everything you would need. The room is spacious and very comfortable. Location wise it is a quiet area but only 20 mins from the city on the tube. Perfect if you want to spend time in London but not pay ridiculous money. Highly recommended:)
Amazing host! Kim always was helpful and informative and her place is very warm and pleasant to stay!

This was fantastic accommodation in a great location with a super friendly host. I stayed ahead of a work event and found the whole process from check-in to check-out absolutely seamless. Roisin, the host, was super responsive and the room itself was comfortable and the perfect size for me and easily one other. South Wimbledon tube is a short walk away and the house itself is full of character and situated in a lovely spot. Would definitely stay again if the need arises.
Roisin’s place was amazing, she’s an amazing host, very helpful and super friendly. It’s very easy to get around from her place, shops and public transports are very close by, I would recommend this place to anybody travelling to London, we definitely had a good time with her.
Beutiful place with kind host, cool cat<br/>Was really clean and quiet
Roisin is a very nice  and gentle lady, very friendly and easy-going. Her house is very clean and cozy, and there is a big supermarket and a bus stop nearby, very convenient, and she has a very cute cat named Scrabby, I love it! Highly recommended! I will miss her and her Scrabby!
Una casa preciosa en una zona muy bonita y tranquila.<br/>Roisin súper amable, muy agradable y simpática, detalles de platos y cubiertos que me han encantado.<br/>Preocupada por si tenía frío y cosas parecidas, que se agradece muchísimo.<br/>Una muy buena opción para estar en Londres.
Roisin is such a gorgeous host ! We've spent a wonderful week in London in Roisin's house, near from Tube, restaurants and pubs ! The house is really clean and peaceful, and Roisin gave us a lot of advices and informations about visiting London ! <br/>If you go to Roisin, you'll meet Scrabby too, a cute and wonderful ginger cat 😍<br/>If you like quiet places, sharing with people and cat, Roisin's house is made for you ! <br/>Thanks a lot for this week !!
I had travelled for a course up in Wimbledon and it was certainly home away from home. <br/>From the moment one crosses the threshold into Roisin’s house, it is as one is part of the family. Neat and clean house, with the luxury of having the opportunity to use the kitchen to make ones own meals and space in the house to relax thereafter which is an extra bonus. <br/>Shops are a 5 minute walk away with a 24hour Bus service (57) going into London and a 10 minute ride by bus into Wimbledon Town Centre. Very very awesome!! <br/>Would definitely recommend the place to all.
Roisin’s place is fantastic. She truly makes you feel at home and is a lovely person to talk to. All the amenities are in working order and the location is great, just around the corner from sainsburys and aldi. Scrabby her cat is super kind and loves a pat, he’s a great asset. I can’t recommend Roisin’s place more!
My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Roisin. Her house is lovely and has all the amenities you could possibly need. The hosts, Roisin and Scrabby were very welcoming and made us feel at home and we would love to stay there again if we have the chance. Would definitely recommend!
My stay with Roisin was perfect. She is super friendly and very easy to get along with! The house was lovely and was a home away from home for me. Stayed for 3 weeks while settling into a new job and was a fantastic base. Couldn’t recommend enough. Oh and Scrabby the cat is brilliant company :) suitable for short and long stays

I had an amazing stay, and just loved their heart warming hospitality.
Perfect room!
Very nice and hospitable host, nice cozy room, close to bus/tube
Absolutely beautiful place. Zara offered to make me breakfast which is unheard of with Airbnb. Great family too. The room comes with TV and free tea which is amazing. Nice bed. Amazing bathroom and shower. Such a lovely place, its a shame i couldnt extend my stay because the room was fully booked for 6 weeks
Very friendly hosts with a very nice communication. The room it’s very comfy and has TV and a few extras as bottle of water, coffee and tea. Very thanks for the early breakfast since I had to leave for work early.

As a single female traveller, safety is of key importance and as such, I felt extremely safe staying with Marcus.  He has been nothing short of a gentleman and I've been extremely comfortable at his apartment.  It felt like I was staying with a 'good friend' that I had known for years! He was very hospitable and respectful and I found him to be very knowledgeable of ALL things London- Ask him anything: History, architecture, Monarchs--he'll know the answer and he's fascinating to listen to.  Trust me on that...<br/>His flat is located on the lovely Tooley Street, in what I consider to be one of London's top neighbourhoods.  You can pretty much walk to all the major attractions from his location and if you need to take public transport, it is a short walk to London Bridge station.<br/>His flat is spacious, 'homely' and very tidy. It is also quiet and the bed is really comfortable - so I slept really well! <br/>Overall, I can't recommend staying with him enough. I'm so glad I did. <br/>
Marcus! was an amazing host, he showed me around the city which was very kind of him. We also shared an interesting night out! it was great to explore the city from a local point of view! The apartment is greatly located near the London bridge and walking distance to the tube. I would definitely stay here again! Thanks so much for your kind welcome! <br/><br/>Bests <br/>R.
Thanks Marcus. I booked late in the day for that night and Marcus responded within 30 minutes! He was at a party but broke off to welcome me and make me feel completely at home by showing me around, making me comfortable, getting me on to hi wi-fi and offering a cuppa. The bed is a dream, I've not used a memory foam mattress before, it was perfect. I live in a very quiet part of the country, so noise is an issue when I stay in London. Even though there was train and traffic noise, the bed made a positive difference, I went out like a light. The rooms were clean as was the linen and several big towels and the description of the host and apartment was accurate. All in all, a good stay. 
Great location and gracious host. 
Totally enjoyed my stay at Marcus' apartment.  He was a welcoming host and did everything to accommodate us during our stay.  The apartment is located near Tower Bridge, right next to a bus stop that stops at the nearby underground stop but the underground is also within a few minutes walk if you're up to it.<br/>New Years, as expected, was crazy busy but the fireworks display was well worth it!  Overall, we had a great stay here.  Would definitely recommend! <br/>
My stay with Marcus was absolutely perfect. He is a very gracious host and will do anything he can to make your stay enjoyable. The flat is ideal for someone who wants privacy. It was very easy to come and go as I pleased without having to worry about disturbing Marcus. He is very flexible about check-in/check-out. This flat is definitely a good choice for someone who is young and might stay out late. I felt completely comfortable coming home very late, sleeping in very late, or even coming home mid-afternoon for a nap. Having said that, it would also be an excellent flat for a business or professional individual. It's a very classy, quiet area and very convenient to get to anywhere in London. I very much enjoyed my stay and would recommend Marcus to anybody looking to stay in London inexpensively!
We stayed with Marcus for one night whilst in London for a friend's wedding.  He was a very relaxed host, friendly and easy going about arrival times and us being out late.  The location was perfect as we were going out to Bermondsey St which was within easy walking distance.  The bedroom was comfortable and quiet and we got a great night's sleep; didn't hear Marcus moving about the flat at all.  A nice relaxed stay!
only 2 words......amazing host   !!!!!!!!
Marcus is the host of all hosts.  The master for sure. As he fad some spear time Marcus and I had a brunch that evolved to a great day with sightseeing är.  A friendship was born.
Thanks a ton to Marcus, who was patient enough to respond to my endless queries before i actually booked my stay.<br/><br/>I made a booking on the same day when i had to check in the evening.<br/><br/>He made me feel very comfortable at his place and was kind enough to guide me to nearby places and amenities. The bedroom was extremely comfortable just next to the bathroom, almost gives you a feeling of an en-suites room. The apartment is located at a very centrally located place, with absolutely no noise from the busy streets of London. Everything was just perfect to stay with him including cleanliness, beds, linens, towels, kitchen facilities.<br/><br/>All in all it was just a perfect place to stay !! I enjoyed every bit of it and look forward to stay over again.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Tushar

Excellent accommodation and a wonderful friendly host.  I was extremely tired after a long drive down from Glasgow and slept like a log in a really comfortable bed. Will stay here again.
Alex's stylish double room is exactly as advertised; beautiful, well lit and welcoming. Alex is detail oriented and responsive. I was extremely pleased with my brief stay with Alex and would certainly do so again on my next visit to London.
Wonderful host, great house! Not just a pleasant stay but we had a memorable experience, this place is certainly a hidden gem at Streatham.

Cant wait to go back! The place was tidy with a great modern style. I couldn't recommend this place enough, Chidem was a grest host.
The apartment was better than I expected! Everything was very well organized, the place was very clean, spacious with many amazing details ! You can find there everything you need and more! The place is close to public transportation, the neighborhood is safe! The kitchen was very well equipped and it was a pleasure to cook there! <br/>Highly recommended!! <br/>I’m definitely going to stay there again!
Chidem’s flat is by far the most amazing Air BnB that I had the opportunity to stay in.<br/>Not only is the flat super stylish, squeaky clean, comfortable and spacious (all equipment-washing machine, dish washer are brand new, fridge is stocked with welcome drinks, there are plenty of welcome snacks too)-Chidem is an excellent host! She lives above the property and goes above and beyond to make her guests feel welcome! <br/>She responds to all messages super quick, happy to help with any questions or requests you might have. <br/>Chidem has even very kindly took care of my doggy when I had an urgent trip abroad!<br/>Beti (my doggo) and I enjoyed the stay so much that if I hadn’t been moving out of the UK, I would rent the space for good!<br/>That flat is amazing, Chidem is amazing and you will not find a better place in London!:)
This is a beautifully new, modern, clean flat at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac street. No through traffic, the only thing we heard in the mornings where birds singing. Beautiful West Ham Park is steps away, a daily stroll through the flower gardens is a must! The flat is tastefully furnished, all the appliances are new. Communicating with Chidem was also very easy, she responded very quickly to all our queries. Away from the crushing tourists but close enough to everything else, take it from seasoned Airbnbers, very highly recommended!
The flat is wonderfull. Chidem is a very sympatic and caring host. I recommend. The perfect place to sleep in London.
Wonderful apartment which was perfect for my stay in London with my dog. Great host who was very quick to help out and respond. Would stay there again without hesitation!
Chidem's place was beautiful, newly refurbished, clean and very spacious for a one bedroom flat. We loved our stay for 2 months as the flat was very cosy. Chidem's team could not really help at times, but Chidem herself was always available and very kind at helping
Chidem’s flat was lovely, and just as expected from pictures. The bed was comfortable and the living space was plentiful, I especially loved the kitchen, which was very spacious. Just one thing it lacked was a microwave, which may be a minor issue for some but I did not mind it. Communication with Chidem and her guest team was quick and efficient and I had no issues there. Would definitely recommend
I loved staying at this place, it was clean, nice, and felt very homely

We spent a lovely journey in London thanks to Tsengel and her family! <br/>The house was clean, warm, friendly. We enjoyed being there and we would have loved to stay there for two months ! There is a bus station: less than 15 minutes walk to get in the center of London in less than 30 minutes. There are shops around. <br/>We just loved being in a family, in particular in this family which was so adorable to us. 🥰 We will be back soon!! <br/>Thank you for everything! <br/>We had our own bedroom with a long desk,  2 chairs, a wardrobe and a big piece of furniture to stock our things. There was even space to put my mat to do my sport routine haha! <br/>We had many surprises as we’ve been offered more hangers, new slippers, a fridge! So we had our own fridge in our room and as we were close to Easter 🐣 we got chocolate from Tsengel that was just so sweet! <br/>Tsengel was always ready to help us and to make ourselves at home! <br/>The bathroom was ours and we could of course use the kitchen and living room. The kitchen is fully furnished! Microwave, oven, hotplates, etc. <br/>The house is luminous and we loved to hear the children laugh, play together, sing, play piano etc. It was just pure joy and we felt safe (because we had a bad experience in an other airbnb when we first arrived in London). <br/>As my boyfriend and I are shy, we ate in our bedroom and Tsengel told us multiple times that we could enjoy the living room if we wanted, that was very nice! <br/>Pickles is the sweetest dog 🐕 so funny and loving we loved cuddling him! As an anxious person, it is so good to have a pet around !! 🥰 <br/>It’s a long review but it’s only positive!! Thank you so much 🌞<br/>If you want to come in France, you are welcome! 🇫🇷
We had a lovely time. Tsengel was just amazing. Always ready to help and super available. The house is also lovely. Thanks a lot!!!
Very friendly and accommodating reception;  although we booked one room at modest cost, we were given the run of the family house, and were guarded by their friendly Labrador.
The bedroom has a comfortable bed, TV, mini fridge, desk, drawers and a place to hang up your clothes. You have easy access to your room, close to the front door and the bathroom is right across the hall. <br/>Tsengel most generously invited us into her family space and we enjoyed interacting with her three children and sweet dog, Pickles. She had other guests upstairs which was also nice to interact with while eating or cooking a meal. <br/>Tsengel is a considerate, kind and helpful person; we are so happy we stayed with her family.
Tsengel was a lovely host, very helpful and communicative . 100% recommend
Tsengel and her family were really nice and welcoming! I felt very comfortable during my stay, would highly recommend!
A great stay with Tsengel, her family and the lovely Pickle. Everyone made me feel really welcome into their home. Room was great and totally as described, really well equipped and a comfy bed. A Greta stay and I would highly recommend.
Very tidy and lovely Airbnb equipped with everything you need. The house is clean and comfortable. Tsengel is so friendly and accommodating.
La zona es muy bonita, distante de los terminales de bus. <br/>La casa es muy cómoda y acogedora. <br/>El servicio de cocina y servicios fueron los ofrecidos. <br/>La anfitriona fue muy gentil. Nos dio facilidades para el checkin y nos brindó hospitalidad. <br/>Tienen en casa un perro encantador. Si te gustan los perros disfrutarás el lugar. <br/>Estamos muy complacidos.
Amazing stay! Very comfortable and well equipped. Tsengel welcomed us warmly and helped us a lot. Really enjoyed having chats with Tsengel. Feels just like home! Highly recommended.

The room is a normal / standard London room by far its not luxury but your stay would be very pleasant there. Also has a TV and all. And its great value for money as well! I recommend!
Clean, welcoming and really well priced. An absolute no-brainer if you’re looking to stay in the Clapham area. Will definitely stay again. Thanks Natalie!

The best thing to know is that Emily-Jane, her dogs and her house (and the luxurious bedding!) are all as wonderful as they appear on her profile. The neighborhood is awash with terrific little coffeehouses, breakfast places, excellent food at the pub just down the street, plus pharmacy, market, etc., very close walking distance. Transportation is easy. I'm a little reluctant to say that I have no complaints: I don't want her place to be filled up next time I do to London.
Perfect stay in London! Emily-Jane is an amazing, welcoming host, and her home is just as beautiful as the photos. Wait till you see the back garden! I felt very lucky to be able to stay with Emily-Jane (and her two sweet dogs). Great communication in advance, and she checked in with me throughout my stay and offered recommendations for the neighbourhood and around London. The room is beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable, and the neighbourhood has a lot of charm, great pubs, and easy access on transport to the rest of London. Can’t recommend enough and can’t wait to stay again! Thank you for everything!
Fab room in a lovely home. Emily-Jane is a welcoming and considerate host. Highly recommended.
This was such a lovely experience to live with Emmy, Moon and Merlin. They offered lots of help and kept the house clean and beautiful. If you love art, life and animals, you will love this cute house so much which has become part of my best memory of London. Btw…all the posters in this house are amazing. Just love everything here and highly recommend it to everyone:)
A wonderful and warm home with a very kind and hospitable host. Emily-Jane’s house is exactly what I hope to have one day. Thank you so much!
had a lovely long-term stay, peaceful and clean home, location is perfect and super quick to get into central and east london.
Emmy, Merlin and Moon were a pleasure to live with. The home is beautiful and everything is the best quality and there is such attention to detail. Emmy is warm, welcoming and friendly - making you feel at home, without too much fuss. The office space to work in was an added bonus. Very much recommend!
I stayed there for a month. Emily-Jane (and her wonderful dogs) made me feel like home right from the start. Emily-Jane is an excellent host, going above and beyond to make the house and stay enjoyable. The room and office (where I worked from home) are beyond great. The bedroom is very comfortable, kitchen is great for cooking. It was an excellent stay!
Staying at Emmy’s place is home from home. It’s in a great location for getting around South London (and further into the city too) on a quiet street. Really comfortable room, lush bed (I slept really well!) and cosy. Was made to feel welcome and at home from the start. This made my business trip better - knowing i had a little haven to retreat to at the end of long days! Emmy is a wonderful host and her place is great value for money. Recommend.
Emily-Jane war eine super offene und zuvorkommende Gastgeberin, sie war stets bemüht, dass es mir gut geht und ich mich wohl fühle. Ihr Hunde sind zuckersüß und ihr co-Gastgeber ist super freundlich gewesen. <br/>12/10
