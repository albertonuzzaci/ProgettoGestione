REVIEWS:

->This was a very disappointing stay with numerous issues. After booking Emiliano told us weeks later that we would not be able to check in until after 8pm which was extremely inconvenient. After email exchanges however we were able to check in around 10 (so a lot of fuss for nothing) and there appeared to be people in the apartment all morning, so was left unsure why he told us we would not be allowed to check in before 8!<br/>Before arriving Emiliano sent a few pushy emails suggesting we sweep, mop and hoover the room. I personally feel this is the hosts responsibility (however of course give the respect to leave it clean and tidy). Upon arrival I was shocked he could demand such expectations of cleanliness when the apartment is so disgusting. The bathroom looked like it had not been cleaned for years with grime accumulated in every corner. Hairs and dust were on every surface and bugs roamed the floor. <br/>The hallways floor was unclean leaving us to tread dust and dirt into the room. <br/>The kitchen and room were fine. Clean and comfortable bed.<br/>Emiliano kept stressing we must clean as the next guests were coming straight after us so I could only presume he does not clean the sheets in between guests. 
->Emiliano is very kind and answered kindly my questions before travelling. Though I couldn't meet him Emiliano's friends were cooperative. You can use their kitchen. Location is good but you usually have to walk 10-20 minutes to bus stop or subway station. <br/>Room is quite clean but bed's mattress was sagged. 
->Decent room, helpful host
->Great location and price.  Specific check in timing needs to be arranged with Emiliano.  Roommates were quiet when we were there.  Nice simple clean room. It's a good deal.    
->Room was nice and a good size. Emiliano was very friendly too. Hallway/bathroom a little bit grubby but overall was well worth the price.
->The host is very kind and communictive. The location is very good - close to the city centre.

REVIEWS:

->Noisy flat
->We never met Franciene, but her friend met us and was very friendly. The apartment is about two blocks from a tube stop and it's very easy to get to and from the city. The outside was a little weird because they were doing construction, but the apartment itself was very nice and we were given clean towels. My only complaint is that the wifi was down for the duration of our stay.
->Staying at Francine's 3 bedroom flat was nice. The flat is in a great location if you plan on using the tube and even has a Sainsbury's right by it. This place is a great deal for what you get. You do have to share the bathroom and kitchen with other Airbnb guests but it wasn't a problem for my fiancé and I. The last thing I would write about the flat is that you should let Francine know your ETA because she has a guy that lives downstairs let you in.
->Das Zimmer war ansprechend und sauber! Es hat alles super geklappt! <br/>
->I didn't meet Franciene but Bruno who was so kind.<br/>But I didn't like my flat because we were not in the room on the first photo but the second. And it makes a big difference. It's a very little bedroom. <br/>And There is some new construction just under the window!! They start at 7:30 a.m. and you can't stay sleeping. I think it's something that Franciene should say ! Because of that even if the flat has a good location our stay was not as well as we thought. 
->Really good place to enjoy London... Underground station is behind the corner and the city centre is very close. Recommended!
->Una agradable estancia. Limpio, con todo lo necesario, buena localización y muy atentos. Sin duda repetiría.
->공항에서 오는 방법을 설명해주었고 숙소근처 지하철역에 내렸을때 잠깐 헤맸는데 메신저로 연락을하여 정확한 위치를 알려주었다. 관광지들이랑 매우가깝다. 위치가 이 숙소의 가장큰 장점이라고 생각한다
->Muy buena ubicación, fácil conexión con el metro, muy buena atención de Bruno que nos recibió en la casa gente muy cordial y recomendable estancia, la habitación luminosa, agradable, limpia, confortable
->The flat is situated very close to a metro station, walk distance 3 minutes.<br/>In the flat there are three rooms,as we realized,our room was the smallest. We get another room as on the pictures was. The room was very small but enough for a couple, because we were in the room only for sleeping. A little bit dirty was our room.<br/>We never met Franciene, but her friend Bruno was very friendly,kind and helpful.He always helped by any problem.<br/>For a couple who are coming just for sightseeing,the flat is perfect.

->A very cosy little room :)
->Basement room a bit scary, changed room for a more expensive one.
->This place is located directly across from King’s Cross/St Pancras International train station. It has no bells or whistles but it was perfect for me. If you plan on spending a lot of your time in your room while in London, you may want to look elsewhere.
->Personnel très gentil et très serviable, très arrangeant! Juste sur l’annonce il n’était pas mentionné que la salle de bain était commune. Mais sinon rien a dire c’était le top!

REVIEWS:

->I had a great stay at this airbnb. The flat is just as pictured and the location is very ideal. It has good transport links and you’ll be right next to a tube station that will get you into central London quickly. The host is responsive and accommodating.
->Se van a encontrar con una habitación súper completa y cómoda. Con buenas conexiones para todas partes en metro. Y el anfitrión tuvo el detalle de dejar muchos artículos a disposición de los huéspedes. (vajilla, secador de pelo, papel higiénico, aceite, azúcar, Sal, jabón para ducha y para ropa, Shampoo y Crema de enjuague entre otros). Súper recomendable!!!
->Good
->ótima e sem problemas.
->Close to the tube and it's a quick trip to central London. The neighbourhood seems a bit shady. Room is what you expect, fine for a few days. The bathroom was nice a clean with a good shower head.
->Definitely recommend, super clean and has everything you need for a stay- plates, glasses, washing machine, shampoo, soap etc and the host is very fast and kind. Next to a tube station that takes you straight into central and loads of food shops near by. Perfect for a short stay in London!
->This is a brilliant property! The room was exceptionally clean, well-equipped, smartly decorated in a modern style and comfortable. Whilst the space is compact, it is very well-furnished and had everything we needed. The host has done an amazing job at fitting all the necessities and more into a relatively small space - I was very impressed! The location is fantastic and convenient. The property is very close to Seven Sisters Station (less than 1 minutes walk!) and there are many local amenities within walking distance. We couldn’t have asked for better! We found it perfect for visiting Finsbury Park for Community Festival. We will definitely look to stay here again should we return to the area in future.
->The room was a good place to stay in London for a reasonable price. We had the hottest days ever, so it has been very hot in the room as well. If traffic noise is a problem for you, you should bring some earplugs. In front of the window there is a street lamp lighting the bed. The room, shower and toilet are clean. The check in and check out went very well.
->séjour agréable dans un logement propre et sympa. Seul bémol, avec la chaleur, obligation d ouvrir la fenêtre, mais difficile de dormir car la rue est très bruyante. Gros avantage du logement, l accès au métro à 2 min.
->We stayed here for three weeks while looking for a flat in London. Unfortunately we did spot baby cockroaches on a few occasions in the toilet and shower room. We informed the host and received a small refund which we appreciated. The washing machine provided was also very dirty and we had to clean this ourselves. There was no cleaning throughout our stay. Neighbourhood was a bit sketchy with some characters around at night but very close to the tube. There are also three flights of steep narrow stairs to get to the room and the carpet was very dirty in the hallway.

->Place is nice and matching pictures. Hassan - another guy from the agency (owner) met me and check-in was fast and smooth, same was check-out. Place is nice, reminds me of Chicago 30s somehow. Great value-price in beautiful area, near the Park and Oxford street :-)
->Ali est une personne très accueillante et sympathique. Il répond très vite à nos demandes. L’appartement était très bien situé, à quelques minutes à pieds de l’arrêt de bus, de la station de métro et entouré de restaurants et d’un magasin alimentaire. L’appartement est conforme aux photos, nous n’avons pas été déçus et avons passé un agréable séjour
->The location is great. You're connected to the whole of London with 2 metrostations and multiple busstops within 8 minutes of walking. And on top of that, you've got a huge and beautiful park just around the corner. <br/>The apartment is also really nice, and very clean. It's a perfect stay for one or two people, and it really has a good price-quality ratio.<br/>Lastly, the host, Ali, is very kind, quick to respond to any questions, and very helpful.<br/>All in all a place to recommend, and for any future trips to London I would definitely stay here again.
->This is a small studio and the pictures are accurate. The bed was VERY uncomfortable. There wasn’t a house manual with information about the space or neighbourhood. It wasn’t very clean – dirty around doorknobs and handles, light switches etc. Very sparse supplies: 1 hand towel for two people to share, barely enough toilet paper for the visit, no tissues, partial bag of sugar the only condiment in the cupboard.
->Great flat in a very convenient part of London, just a brief walking distance from Hyde Park and in close vicinity to various public transportation options; also, many restaurants and convenience markets around the corner, a very lively part of the city. Ali is a responsive and considerate host, he provided clear instructions and communication overall. Thank you for having us as your guests!
->位置近巴士站，但地鐵站要行10-15分鐘，<br/>樓下對面馬路有兩間超市，<br/>大門舊，屋內較熱，隔音差，建議增設冷氣。
->Before anything do not stay here! The host has anger management issues and I was insulted and aggressively attacked! I had sent prior messages to him early in the morning to ask him if he would be so kind as to let me have a late check out and I did not hear from him for few hours and I had fallen asleep in the sofá to this loud banging on the door that scared me as I thought some people were breaking into the flat and rob me and when I opened the door Mr Ali starting shouting at me not letting me have a chance to speak a word to defend myself of why I didn’t leave the studio earlier and I’ve told him I had fallen asleep in the sofa and he still goes on and on and my partner arrives to help me with the luggage and he turned to my party and told him to get out of the building immediately because it was only me who was the guest and not two people and my partner only came to help me carry my luggage and had to be subjected to such inhumane manners and foul language and verbally insulted ! It’s the worse check out I ever had in my life and the way I was kicked out with him grabbing my belongings and throwing them in the hallway when I kept telling him to not touch my stuff ! There were moments that he was coming towards when I thought he was going to hit me and I had to finish my packing in just 2 minutes and I had had cleaned the whole studio hours earlier to be treated this way ! It’s a traumatising experience that I won’t ever be able to forget and can’t understand how come he still is allowed to host in Airbnb or on any sites whatsoever ! This kind of person should be banned from listing properties !

I will not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone who is coming to London!
->首先要夸夸房东！这是我遇见过的最好的房东，人特别好！她给了我们很多关于伦敦自由行的建议，包括一些小众独特的体验和美食推荐，在生活上也帮助了我们很多。整个房源很好，房间很大，睡三个人很合适，而且房间在一楼，外面有独立门，没有人打扰，房间很安静。房子交通也很便利，走路五分钟之内有好几个地铁站，可以去伦敦各大景点和市中心。房源里生活用品很充足，真的让我们有家的感觉，“宾至如归”。总而言之，强烈推荐这个房源，性价比很高，来伦敦住这绝对不会后悔！

Zur Station sind es etwa 10 Minuten zu Fuß. <br/>Es gibt auch einen Bus, der ca. 30 Minuten bis zur London Bridge benötigt. <br/>Auch zu späterer Stunde  ist die Anbindung gut.

->Lovely clean, airy & spacious room with fridge/freezer, desk & hanging space. Bathroom was clean & shower had hood pressure! Would return for a future stay
->The room is specious and clean . but I asked before booking which floor is it and I was told first floor and when I arrived it was on the second . its was very hot and when I asked for a fan the response was we didn't say that we supply fans while the room is under the roof so it's really very hot and very noisy because 4 window directly on the main street and the light goes in too . the buses vibrates the room other than the noise . the toilet technique is disgusting as the toilet flashes from the sink water so it flash with dirty water and tap water doesn'twork till the toilet is full. on the other hand the host always replies and quickly but not helpful . the main problem in this place is before you arrive the send you an agreement 24hrs before arrival that you have to sign . many many rules and penalties to an extent if you didn't empty you rubbish bin you pay penalty and most of all they are not responsible for your theft or death or anything happens to you in their property and the owner is allowed to enter your room in emergency or if he wasn't able to reach you.  sending emails every 2 days starting from time of booking till check out with restrictions makes it so uncomfortable. you feel you want to run away and you feel terrified in every step and revise it in your mind if it's written or not.  and because they send it only 24hrs before arrival you will have to sign it because its a non refundable reservation and its very difficult in short time to find another place. would be my last option to go back there one day. only if I have too.  because of the management not the place.  as I said the place is clean and specious and good location .

Klidná lokalita, dostatek obchodů a dostupných restaurací. Hostitel byl opravdu přátelský a rád se vším poradil. Pobyt doporučujeme pro nenáročné turisty.

REVIEWS:

->Great place to stay. I felt welcome.
->Correspondant à mes attentes, lieu calme et bien placé
->When I arrived the bed was unmade with disgustingly stained sheets, I had to send photos to the host as his English was really bad. It was awful, I then had to leave for a few hours so that fresh bed lining could be put on. Not good
->Very happy with the stay
->Simple, Clean, good price.
->The house is near Canary Wharf
->Lovely host! Great location and easy to get to Canary Wharf :)

->- Bed was broken<br/>- not very clean<br/>+ you can lock your luggage in your room<br/>+ near to the center<br/>+ shared kitchen to use
->The location is good and it’s clean! Great!
->worth the money for sure
->Chambre propre et logement bien placée idéal pour un court séjour à Londres. <br/>Rapport qualité prix correct. Attention toutefois aux personnes qui ont le sommeil léger, nous entendons les bruits de rue (transport en commun) et pas de volet et de rideaux opaques contre la lumière.
->The stay fulfilled everything it promised, although the apartment could use some minor adjustments and better mattresses and pillows. Over the weekend the apartment can be quite a noisy place.
->Bonnie was well in reach and quick turn around for any queries
->it's the perfect flat if you are in London to visit as a male turist.<br/>However, I would not reccomend it for female guests. The area was quite scary at night-time.
->Great location
->Very comfortable room, easy access and great facilities. Well worth the money. The only downside was that the guests staying in the room next door were VERY noisy, slamming doors at 3am and talking loudly. But this was not the hosts fault at all. Other than this, a very pleasant and enjoyable stay.
->Super :)

REVIEWS:

->It was a pleasure staying at Epi's house. It was tastefully decorated, conveniently located and Epi was a great host. I will stay there again.
->The host is very nice and helpful for information what you need!
->Not the best stay I've ever had. The bed wasn't as described even if I asked beforehand to make sure. Not too comfortable, noisy and bumpy bed. The host seemed a bit cocky when I approached her to comment some issues. She's very noisy as well (loud cow's laughter).
->Was perfect for what I needed, good value for money and a nice quiet location. Room was clean and tidy and the house was only a 15 minute walk from station so perfect for my commute. Epi is very helpful and communicative and made sure I had everything I needed. Will stay again in future if I am in the same area.
->It was great, nothing to say really I loved my stay at Epi. To advise without hesitation it is great
->Inaccurate description of the location o2 Greenwich is a 45minutes drive away. This house was located in a very isolated area and train was often out of service on weekends. The room had no lock on it so i had to carry my valuables items everyday with me. Also there was no towel or hand soap available. There was one shower and toilet available and if anyone were using the shower, others had to wait for a long time to finally use the toilet. <br/>On top of everything the mattress was old and the springs were also broken so I always woke up with awful backpain.
->Epi was very kind and helpful <br/>The room is good, my journey was perfect<br/>Thanks again

REVIEWS:

->Kate war durchgehend sehr bemüht uns zu unterstützen, hat rasch auf alle Fragen geantwortet und uns stets das Gefühl vermittelt, dass es ihr ein persönliches Anliegen ist unseren Aufenthalt bestmöglich zu gestalten. Danke! 
->Simple et chaleureuse.<br/>Loger dans cette petite maison nous a permis de passer une agréable semaine à Londres. 15 mn de métro puis 15 mn à pied, mettent le centre de Londres facilement accessible.
->Kate and Renato‘s house is located near good supermarkets and has also fast access from Stansted Airport, either by car or by train. They also have a super fast internet connection, and communication with them was easy. <br/>However, our stay was unfortunately disturbed by many crucial aspects: (1) some parts of the house were in an extremely dirty state. We found lots of dust and lost objects under the beds and on the futton mattress and mould on the sofa and the futton. Also the kitchen floor and utensils (each one of which we had to rewash before using for the first time) hadn’t been properly clean. When we wrote a complaint about the dirtiness, the hosts didn’t take it well and didn’t believe what we said. They sent us a receipt from the company hired to clean the house before we checked in as a response, as if a receipt was any proof of actual cleaning (clearly the cleanliness was not inspected after the job completion). They even told us we were not supposed to move furniture when we checked the state under the beds and that dust under them is acceptable for “an old Victorian house with open floor boards”; (2) it’s not in a very good location. Despite the supermarkets and the proximity to STN airport, it is 10 km away from the city center and not so close to the subway, as the ad suggests. It is at least a 20 min walk to Seven Sisters station (zone 3), or one can take bus 41 at Philip Lane stop, travel for 3 stops and exit at Seven Sisters. Not only that, but the neighbors were also loud at night, and we could hear everything from the streets through the windows; (3) some other issues: the ad mentions a clothes dryer, which does not exist; it was a bit struggling to take a shower, as very little water came out from it; one of the light spots on the living room ceiling must have been damaged, as two lamps we connected to it burned out during our stay.

REVIEWS:

->This is an amazing home for you to quickly settle into. The communication with the host was great. The home itself is beautiful and clean. I would recommend this stay to everyone!
->Very responsive host, responding to queries promptly. Nice, newly-renovated place. Just one negative point about the stay, my room was given to another guest while I was still staying here. He entered while I was sleeping. This unpleasant experience went by without any acknowledgement or apology.
->Adaer was a fantastic host and very communicative. The whole property was so clean and tidy at all times. The location is great too. I would highly recommend!
->Really nice stay, clean :-)
->Nice and clean. This house shares up to 6 Airbnb rooms so there’s a fair bit of traffic having said that the house is cleaned regularly and the host seems to take their business seriously
->Staying at Norman Guest House was my first and it will be the last stay I’ve ever experienced in my life and my first stay through Airbnb.Honestly I don’t know where to start from.First impression was the check in.Tried to call the host but no reply.Then we exchanged few text messages because I couldn’t figure out the lock.Finally I got in the guest house.The room was on the first floor.That was fine.But I was so disappointed because it was not like in the pictures.Bad paintwork ,very small wardrobe,the bed not sturdy enough and I was very careful while I was sleeping in it and getting up.<br/>It was very unstable and you can think it will collapse any minute.<br/>All doors in the house were very screechy and noisy-closing and opening.Definitely need a good oiling or WD40 for the hinges.That noise kept me awake all night as different guests use the shared bathroom on my floor and you could hear all the noise from opening and closing the doors.<br/>So,no good night sleep for me.I haven’t been to other guest houses with shared bathroom and kitchen but in this one is like all the filthiest people were staying.I did cleaning myself of the bathroom,hallway,stairs and the whole kitchen.<br/>The cleaning ladies were amazing and were doing their best in the common areas.<br/>But the minute they finished cleaning and I mean between 4 and 8 hours cleaning non-stop,and leave the house-the mess and dirt starts again.I don’t know where the host finds these people or more likely the people coming to Norman Guest House are homeless or living in very bad conditions but they don’t have any respect and care about the common area.<br/>I tried to be on top of the cleanliness because it is like that in my own property.<br/>At the end of the day wherever you go you bring yourself.Of course the other guests noticed that between cleaning ladies visits I was the one who cleaned after them but they kept doing it.I am speechless.Yes,ignorance is a bliss for some.<br/>We didn’t have hot water and gas for cooking twice but the host did his best to sort the issue out.<br/>Other thing was with the sewage.Bugs and bad smell were coming from one of the sewages in the garden.The one that runs from top floor bathroom,goes down the first floor bathroom and also the pipe that comes from the kitchen sink.All that went down in one of the sewages and because of blockage or something else the bugs were mostly there and they were coming into the house.The lady that was staying in room 2 couldn’t open her room window because the bugs were going directly into her room.She kept the window closed most of the time.<br/>Also because some of the guests were staying for just one or two nights and we didn’t know them they were leaving the front door wide open all night.I didn’t feel safe at the house.<br/>Some of the guests contaminated the ground floor and first floor with some bacteria and one of the ladies was infected and she went to see a GP and was on antibiotics for a week.Very unhygienic people were staying at the house.Ground floor with shared bathroom was okay for some but first floor bathroom I needed to share with 7 other people at times.Imagine the cleaning I did every time I was using it-I mean before using it or after someone been there before me.Constant spraying with antibacterial spray and wiping with wet wipes,  not to mention the filth,soap and hair(body and head) after everyone that has been using the bathroom.<br/>In the kitchen what to say-people don’t know how to wash their dishes and cutlery,don’t clean and tidy after themselves.I’ve been checking every spoon,fork,knife and plate and pans before putting any food or using them.Most of the times I needed to wash everything and then to use it and put food in it.The mugs and glasses were the same-not properly washed from whoever has been using them.Pans not properly washed and left all greasy to dry on the dish rack.<br/>The list is long…<br/>I stayed a month because of my personal circumstances but I will never do that mistake again or to share bathroom and kitchen with random people as most of them were filthy.I wouldn’t recommend staying at Norman Guest House.Not because of the host or the cleaning ladies-they were doing their best,but because of the people these establishments attract.I haven’t been in a hostel or any shelter for homeless people but I felt like that in the guest house.<br/>It will be my last experience with all that sharing bathroom and kitchen. Very overpriced room as well.<br/>I have read the other reviews I am speechless how people give 5 star reviews.
->A great stay. Warm and lovely accomodation.
->I’ll be honest this place is nasty lool the other guest in this place are traamps Lool
->This property is bright, clean and homely.<br/>The bedroom is very spacious and nicely designed. The communal areas kept very clean at all times which makes for a great atmosphere. <br/>The host Adaer has been amazing and I’ll definitely recommend this room to anyone visiting London.
->Adaer is a great host, extremely responsive and very helpful! The place is great for having your own space to settle for the interim in London. It’s relatively close to transport networks, with central line and overground trains a stones throw away. There are all the facilities you would need in the house. 10/10 recommended!

->Très agréable séjour à Londres grâce à cet appartement situé dans un quartier calme. Accueil chaleureux et chambre confortable. À conseiller vivement !
->C'est un très bel appartement, dans un quartier calme et entre 2 stations de métro à 10 Minutes à pied chacune, à quelques minutes en métro de trafalgar square, big ben, London bridge... 
->Decent stay. Gareth was accommodating and sought to rectify any issues quickly. The room was smaller than it looked it the pictures and was a bit unclean but otherwise OK. It is about a 10 minute walk to Kilburn and a 5 minute walk to Brondesbury park overground. Nice area and quiet neighbours too. 
->Clean flat in a nice area. I recommend.
->Byt byl dle očekávání z fotek takový, jaký jsme si ho představovali. Nachází se v blízkosti metra a v pěkné čtvrti. Jen si musíte ve městě koupit adaptér do zásuvky, ale ty se prodávají na každém rohu. Byli jsme spokojení.
->Nice stay. I recomended
->Ce logement est très cher pour ce qu'il est car Londres a beau être une capitale, ce petit studio présentait beaucoup de défauts non signalés dans l'annonce (ménage, équipements de mauvaises qualité...)<br/>De plus, Gareth n'a pas répondu à nos messages jusqu'à ce que l'on arrive devant le logement et qu'on l'appelle. Quelqu'un d'autre nous a remis les clés, décevant...
->Interesting little spot. A little room with a tiny bed. Was kind of tight for two people. All the equipment needed for cooking, no ingredients though. (tea or salt). It is more like a hotel room with kitchenette. Was priced accordingly. Would stay again but maybe with just one person. Found an amazing market a short bus ride away, 'queens park farmers market' open on Sunday's.
->This is the fourth time I have stayed here now and it will not be the last I love the safety of the place the location and most of all dealing with Gareth and his team of staff are a pleasure nothing is too much trouble for any of them I highly recommend this place XX
->Good place, but at least 15 min walk from station. A little far for liking! But very good response to requests from the host.

->Wonderful house. Warm welcome. Doreen answered very quickly. The flat is exactly as the pictures and the review. Perfect for visiting London.<br/>Close to public transport with bus 24 hours. No more to say except that i was perfect. <br/>Thanks doreen.
->Nous avons été accueillies par la fille de Doreen qui a été très claire dans ses explications et très aimable. Doreen a été pleine d'attention en prenant des nouvelles pendant le séjour. L'appartement est proche des transports en commun. Il est facile de trouver de quoi se restaurer dans les parages. Il est convient parfaitement pour trois personnes! Seul bémol, le son des sirènes peut être gênant pour les personnes qui ont le sommeil léger! 
->Good location, all kinds of shops and restaurants nearby, two blocks from train station that can take you to Victoria in 20 minutes. The apartment is small but well equipped. The sofa bed was somewhat bothersome to set up, and had a few issues, but Doreen promised to fix that. She was nice and kept in touch during our stay and communication was good. 
->Appartamento a 5 minuti a piedi da stazione e fermate bus. <br/>Quartiere tranquillo con molto poco rumore.<br/>L'appartamento, anche se piccolino, è fornito di tutto l'occorrente. <br/>Considerato che parliamo di Londra,  il rapporto qualità prezzo è buono. 
->Apartamento muy recomendable y Doreen muy amable
->Appartement à conseiller - Situé près des transports en commun et des commerces (5 mn) - Manque uniquement une machine à laver le linge. Tout le reste est parfait. Propriétaires très gentils et attentifs.
->Good stay
->l'alloggio è pulito ed ordinato.  anche se è lontano dal centro di londra nelle vicinanze dell'appartamento c'è la fermata dell'autobus e della metro. l'host è sempre stata contattabile e ha sempre fornito indicazioni precise.
->Beautiful flat, modern & stylish, host was helpful & kind & the area was quiet & convenient for direct travel to central London. We had a wonderful stay & would definitely use this property again!
->My wife and I enjoyed our stay in the apartment although were a little taken back by the apartment being smaller than the photos.<br/> <br/>The apartment was well equipped and we enjoyed being able to cook dinners in. The bed was comfortable enough for a few nights. The odd bit of noise but really nothing major. <br/> <br/>Overall we found it a good place to stay at a reasonable price. I don’t think you’d find anything better at this price.  <br/>It was a convenient 4 minute walk to the train station and we felt safe walking to and from it day or night. <br/>Thanks again Doreen.
