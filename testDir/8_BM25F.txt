->As a family of 4, Olga made us feel welcome for our month long stay. The flat is well laid out with 3 bedrooms. Good safe neighbourhood, just by the marina and a pleasant (shortish) walk to Canary Wharf.<br/>With its proximity to the DLR, train noise can be an issue.

->Excellent location, great host. Will love to comeback.
->Great host! Modern, clean and well equipped apartment. 1 minute walk to the underground and bus stop.
->Host very helpful and great communication, apartment was easy to get into, very clean and was better than we expected 👍🏽
->A lovely clean and spacious place to stay in London
->Great space and great location!!! Walking distance to so many awesome sight seeing landmarks. Very close to a metro stop. And Amit was wonderful!!! Spacious and multiple bathrooms which was a huge plus!!!!
->Great apartment. Very clean and well thought out. Amit a brilliant host, very responsive and helpful.
->This is a beautiful flat in a great location, especially the proximity to Brick Lane. It is clean and well maintained with plenty of room for our 5 person group. We unfortunately had an experience with the power going out in the flat for about 9 daytime hours during our 2 day stay. Amit was able to have the power restored as quickly as what was within his control as it required an engineer to come and fix. We overall enjoyed our stay!
->I can only recommend the apartment and the host! 10/10.<br/>Super convenient check-in.<br/>Clean apartment. Everything was as described.<br/>Fast internet connection.<br/>Clear and exceptionally swift communication with the host. He was really helpful whenever we had a question.<br/>This was not a real problem for us, but the internet connection was a little bit unstable upstairs as the router is located downstairs. It did work upstairs too but video calls may be a bit laggy if you are in one of the bedrooms upstairs.<br/>All in all great experience. Thank you.
->Really clean and well presented apartment. It was spacious and welcoming. Amit was easy to get in touch with and checked up on us during our stay to make sure we was ok. It is a stones throw away from the tube station. Would recommend to others looking to stay and would happily stay again if the opportunity presented itself.
->Easy checkin, very clean, host was really flexible and kind to let us check in early

->This is the perfect Airbnb. Easy to book, great communication from host and a place that exceeds expectations. We would stay again in a heartbeat. 
->Wonderful apartment. Great hosting. Everything I expected and more. Would definitely stay there again if I had he choice !
->Couldn't rate this apartment and lazer as a host highly enough! Will definitely stay again! Beautiful Veiws and a beautiful apartment.
->If you want a really clean, modern place to stay, with amazing views of the River Thames, then this is it! We really enjoyed our stay here! We consider it family friendly, although our kids are a bit older. It is very close to public transport and very secure.
->Fantastic flat, with stunning views and very close to the DLR (but not too close!). Lazer was a truly great host and checked regularly to  make sure everything was ok.
->This apartment was fantastic! It's new, clean and beautiful and is located on the Prime Meridian Line on the bank of the Thames River and across from the O2. Such a beautiful view! The closest DLR station is just a block away, as is a grocery store that had everything we needed. Lazer responded extremely quickly to any question or comment we had - before, during and after our stay. We'd love to stay here again!
->Made a great last minute holiday - the east end us like a whole new city we'd never explored and the apartment made all it really accessible. DLR so much nicer to use than the tube. The apartment gave us affordable luxury with the self catering we needed for a family. Lazer was always in the end of a phone so we didn't need to worry about s thing. The view and balcony was amazing. Big flat screen to great for the kids. Lots of fun.
->This apartment is in a fabulous location with great views of the Thames and a short walk from Canary Wharf.  The apartment was super clean and comfortable; not a cheap stay but worth it.
->Great place and location.
->The apartment was every bit as shown and described. New, clean and stylish with quality fittings.<br/>The views were spectacular ( especially from the balcony at night )  and the television offered multiple channels for a bit of relaxation at the end of the day.<br/>London is a big sprawling city ( compared to other European capitals ) so need to be mindful transportation is required for most sites, attractions and restaurants ) <br/>Communication with Lazer was excellent. This is very important when in a foreign country and a little unsure before settling in.  <br/>We very much enjoyed the apartment and would recommend to airbnb users.<br/>Dragan

->Sana accepted my booking quickly and was very helpful in accommodating my requirements. She helped to suggest alternative routes when our transportation was affected. The apartment was fine for one night's stay on business with a colleague. 
->From start to finish Sana was a great help. She responded quickly to my request to book. and stayed in contact up to the booking. The traffic was really bad due to an accident on the motorway which delayed us by an hour on the arrival day. Sana was understanding and greeted us with a massive smile and was extremely welcoming. The apartment was very clean and actually quite spacious. both bathrooms were very clean and so was the bedding. <br/>Due to its location next to east india docks and the fact the station is so lit up it made finding the flat at the end of the night very easy.<br/>There was no issues and no negative points to booking this apartment with Sana and if I had to say  one downside at a push, it was I locked myself out of the balcony and couldn't get back in so lucky my mate was in, so ask Sana to show you how to get back in before she leaves. Also the bedrooms were a lot darker then the livingroom at night time so if you have someone using the livivngroom for a bedroom bear that in mind when allocating beds to people. <br/>Thanks Sana you made my 1st airbnb booking a very positive one hopefully see you again soon on our next visit to london

REVIEWS:

->We stayed at Aarav’s place for a weekend in June. The townhouse was a perfect fit for our large group of 8, and actually does have AC, even though we didn’t need it. <br/>The tube stop is very close, so it’s super easy to get anywhere you want in the city.  The location also borders Shoreditch, a very edgy and desirable  area of London that we love. If you’re unaccostumed to  city life, note that this location is lively at all hours, which was desirable for our group. <br/>There are several restaurants very closeby that we enjoyed - Grounded on White Chapel for breakfast was excellent as was for Sushinoen for sushi. <br/>Aarav was super responsive and we’d definitely return next time we are in London.
->Had a great stay !!
->The place is ideal for a family of 6. Neat and lots of space. Very bright.
->This spot is a great deal. Just be aware that the park is not the safest location. We weren’t really bothered but there’s clearly a lot of drug use/unsightly activity there. The police clear out the people but they come back each night. Overall this place and Aarav were a great deal and worth it. But I would keep in mind the park activity when deciding to book. <br/>All the food in the area is delicious and it’s right next to brick lane. <br/>Also pretty centrally located to city of London and the rest of London.
->The flat was perfectly equipped for what we needed for our stay, which was for work purposes. Extremely secure locking system to get inside the house which was reassuring with the park right outside and on the ground floor. The flat was clean and had everything we needed.
->Best Airbnb i’ve stayed at, super easy check in and entry/exit, and amazing homey apartment. Thanks!
->Overall stay was nice. As underground station 5 min walkable distance and have excellent connectivity through out London. But beside garden had not good crowd. It’s not seems that easy in night particularly with family. Also kitchen cutlery should increase as oven is there but bowls are not there similar like. But Aarav(host) response is very friendly. Also grocery store is 2 min walking distance.

REVIEWS:

->Didn’t stay in Daniel’s home (cancelled on site and received a refund via aircover) however I want to express my disappointment in his level of hospitality and service.<br/>Required a £300 offsite deposit to check-in (against Airbnb’s T&Cs) After paying it we waited nearly 2 hours for check-in instructions in a cold and rainy train station.<br/>Home was noticeably dirty, smell was foul, and there is not actually a 3rd bed as the listing indicates. His resolution was to bring a foldable bed in the following day, leaving a person in our party to sleep on a love seat or on the floor. Unacceptable.<br/>Received a refund from Airbnb, Daniel was then rude and combative when asked for confirmation of my offsite deposit refund. Asked me why he needed to provide me any confirmation if he didn’t when I paid mine (surely Stripe did send him confirmation of my payment)<br/>Travelers, I didn’t stay beyond check-in but my experience merits a honest review for others to make their own judgment before booking.
->This place has a laundry washer, heating. The master bedroom has a master bathroom which oozed with sewage smell. We had to open the window which helped some even with air freshner and extra cleaning I performed. I notified host and he said he was not aware of sewage smell from other renters. Not sure where this sewage smell was coming from other than master bathroom. The other bedroom mattress smelled like urine which my daughter's didnt tell me till we were leaving.  Their remedy was placing a large towel as a barrier.  Place is at a good safe location.  The balcony was nice. We couldn't enjoy balcony due to weather. Subway and grocery store 1 block away. Not sure about restaurants in the area since we only walked 3 large blocks before we saw some. If host resolves these small issues, this place works. I'd stay here again.

C'è stato un piccolo problema con l'acqua calda ma è stato fatto di tutto per rimediare prontamente e in cambio abbiamo ricevuto una bottiglia di vino e una scatola di cioccolatini. L'appartamento è nuovo, pulitissimo e dotato di tutti i confort, stoviglie, asciugamani, coperte, ecc. Non abbiamo avuto bisogno di comprare niente. L'appartamento è in un'ottima posizione, in 5 minuti si raggiunge la stazione della metro e del bus e quindi in poco tempo si raggiunge il centro città.<br/>Assolutamente consigliabile.

->The house was amazing ! The pictures on the site say it all! This is a good place to stay if you want to be central! Really like the luxury interior design, everything was there, what I needed. The location is super central and also relaxing and quiet. Next time I will go with Family, because its perfect with kids.

->Staying at the Penthouse was absolutely magical, such a great time. Had great communication with Janet before the arrival date and guided into the property. On check in, Janet was there to check us in and showed us everything we needed to know and explained went through the very handy manual which was very clear, detailed and easy to read, was fantastic having all the information there to hand after they had gone. <br/>Welcome pack with things like milk ect was very welcomed and the recommendations for local places to visit and eat where well appreciated. We also did order a takeaway one night and the delivery of this was smooth and no issues with them finding address. The property itself was nothing short of perfect, Beautiful views over the harbour out of the floor to ceiling windows spanning the 2 floors, plenty of outdoor space including the downstairs balcony and upstairs, very spacious terrace; perfect space for breakfast outside watching over the water. <br/>Bedrooms were so lovely and I had the best 3 nights sleep I have had in along time. The private hot tub... well, what can I say..  Amazing, peaceful, pure bliis.  We all felt very happy on the terrace, in the tub which was constantly heated and so easy to use, a real treat and makes the already beautiful property even more special. <br/>We felt so welcomed and on arrival and after settling in, we fell in love witht he place instantly and checked to see if there was any more time available. We saw there was another day available on the Air bnb calendar and asked if we could book the extra night through the air bnb app as the place was just so beautiful and was all confirmed so 2 nights became 3. <br/>Already hoping to find excuses to go back again haha. Amazing hosts, amazing property, amazing location. The perfect Air bnb experience. <br/>I tried to think of anything that was potentially negative for a future booker and genuinely could not find one fault, none of us could. Highly recommended and thank you so much for an amazing time! x
->The apartment  is really great and specious. The terrace and the jacuzzi are magnificent. Public transport nearby, restaurants and places for kids (farm) make this place a great choice for the stay with family.
->Your place was absolutely amazing. Your hospitality was of the highest calibre. The apartment was completely breathtaking with views all round. Everything was perfect and no problems at all occurred. Would book again in an instant. Thank you so much.
->I really enjoyed my stay at Janet's apartment! Amazing view and very close to the DLR, making it easy to go to Central London or stay locally. I would highly recommend this place and I would definitely stay here again!
->Janet's apartment was perfect for a weekend in London. It was so spacious, very clean with just the most stunning views! The hot tub was amazing, lovely and warm and really good at the end of a busy day in London. It is really well equipped, and Janet was the perfect host letting us know all about the area, where to eat etc and provided key essentials for our short time there. It's a short walk from local restaurants, and only a few minutes from the DLR to get about. We will definitely return to Janet's beautiful apartment in the future.
->Meeting Janet in her very beautiful apartment in a very beautifully appointed location was more delightful than I had anticipated. What a welcome! She apologized profusely that the pull out sofa had not yet arrived but explained the use of the couch on the mezzanine floor for our third person  (two adequate bedrooms and two bathrooms meant each person had their privacy). I slept there very comfortably, with the view of the Docklands and with immediate access to her private hot tub. Brilliant! She left us a bottle of prosecco as a sort of compensation. Sweet! Our only 'disturbance' for our trip, designed to attend the Pizza and Prosecco festival at the O2, was that the local railway (DLR) had stopped services and we were scrambling to figure out our journeys. Overall, I have to say that this host was superb and her apartment is spectacular! Brava!
->Fantastische Aussicht. In der Nähe ist ein Supermarkt und auch verschiedene Restaurants.
->We really enjoyed our stay in this apartment! Photos do not really show how beautiful and cozy it is. Mezzanine floor is amazing, and the view is just breathtaking. We had everything we needed there. Janet left us some bread, milk, butter, and even a bottle of Prosecco, which was very kind of her. Apartment is located in a very quite modern area, which was perfect for us. DLR station is just 5 min away, so you can get to the central part of the city fairly quickly. Uber from the city center cost us about £15-20. We definitely want to stay there in the future and want to thank Janet for everything! 
->Het is een ruim appartement met een super uitzicht . Heerlijke hot tube.
->The place to be <br/>i stay 3night in this penthouse and it was perfect <br/>Mention spéciale pour les français , n’hesitez Pas une seule seconde et faite de cette appartement votre pied à terre pour visiter Londres.<br/>Thank you Janet ! I hope to come Back in your penthouse bye!

REVIEWS:

->I came to london with 2 to of my girlfriends to celebrate my birthday weekend. This flat is located in a lovely hood with lots of restaurants, coffee shops, bars. The apartment was clean and cozy, except it did have cigarette smell that was hard for us to digest. We left windows wide open when we were out to get the fresh air but it still didn't help. I hope the owner will be able to take care of this for future bookings. The owner is really helpful and communicated very well with us. The bedding was clean. I stayed on the pull out sofa, which wasn't the most comfortable to sleep on but it was fine for 3 nights (probably wouldn't be able to sleep for longer than that). The bathrooms and the kitchen were clean and had all necessary accessories for us (shampoo, soup, etc). Overall - we had a great time and I would recommend this place.
->The Host of this property was fantastic, from jumping on a facetime with me when I first arrived, to responding to each of my messages in minutes. We had a situation that needed his attention, and in the middle of Eid, he stepped about to help me. The place was clean and the attention to detail was awesome. I'd mentioned I was brining my kids and an Easter Egg was hidden so the girls could have an egg hunt when we arrived. I do think there is a smoker downstairs, which is unfortunate as we had to open  the windows when we returned to the apartment but aside from that, it was great, plenty of space, even for four, well stocked kitchen to cook in, close to transit and a bunch of great food places within walking distance. It was practical as I needed to be close to the city, but accessible for London adventures.
->Great location and comfortable apartment
->The host is very responsive and accommodating
->Clean, large apartment is the centre of Aldgate. Stayed here whilst on a business trip and had everything I needed. Very close to Aldgate East (5 mins) and a short walk (12 mins) to Liverpool St station. Only small comment would be that the apartment got a little hot during a London heatwave. It was absolutely fine with the windows open during the day, but too noisy to sleep with them open given proximity to the main road. A small fan would have been a welcome addition! Thanks for a great stay though. Would definitely stay again!
->A comfortable, welcoming, bright home with amenities that work well. The location is quite good, we were able to hit favorite spots along Brick Lane. The London Museum isn't too far away. Victoria Park... Burough Market.. The building has a lobby with an attendant on duty. The host makes you feel welcome from the start. and check in was easy.
->Good and nice apartment
->The apartment had a nice layout with two bedrooms and two bathrooms with a spacious lining area. The location isn’t in the nicest part of town.
->Very disappointed overall. Very old building and not so clean apartment, so much for 440£ per night.
->Nice and clean apartment quite close to Tower and Sky Garden. Hence, perfect for our stay. Thank you!

REVIEWS:

->The accommodation check in process was easy, and the location was great (10/10). Unfortunately the accommodation itself was not that good. The entrance to the accommodation looks you’re entering the slums of Mumbai. Once inside, the living room was of a nice standard but wasn’t clean, with stains and dust everywhere. The TV also wasn’t working. Only one shower out of the two was working, and both showers were actually dirty and were blocked. The one shower that worked would cut the hot water off after 2 minutes use (I suspect because the owner wants to limit how much hot water we use!) The biggest issue we had was two people in the party didn’t have any duvets for sleeping because we couldn’t find the linens for the sofa beds, and so had to use the towels as blankets! (Turns out the owner keeps the linens hidden somewhere in the sofa and claims he explains where these are in an ‘apartment guide’ that we weren’t told about and I don’t think exists!). <br/>Overall, for the amount we spent the accommodation was ok, but be prepared for most things not to work or for things to be dirty.
->The Host Was, Amazing
->Clean and well furnished apartment <br/>Good communication from host
->Blinds broken in bedroom letting light in. Tv doesn’t work due to bad signal. Shower in en suite cold. Toilet seat in en suite broken. Good communication and check in details from host
->shops, food, drinks local
->Great location and value for money, some small issues with one shower not turning on but apart from that great! Would stay again :)
->Host has disappointing behaviour and poor response time
->We enjoyed our stay, lovely little apartment with a spacious living room. Great location and good value for money. Parking very close which was reasonably priced too.
->nice clean spacious apartment right in the middle of Shoreditch.  Good find, thanks!
->This apartment was just what we needed (essentially a crash pad for four of us after a night out in Shoreditch) - great location, plenty big enough for us, comfy beds and two bathrooms. Check-in procedure and communication was very good.

REVIEWS:

->We loved our stay at Richard's apartment.<br/><br/>It lived up to its billing and was spacious and well equipped.<br/><br/>The train station is an easy walk and the neighborhood had two supermarkets around the corner--plus plenty of restaurants within a five or six minute walk.<br/><br/>It was a treat to be able to watch live TV and the wifi is very good.<br/><br/>Richard (who was out of town) and his friend Seb who met us and helped us get situated were both very helpful and responded to our emails, texts and phone calls promptly.<br/><br/>We would happily stay there again.
->We had a really great time at Richard’s apartment. He offers a beautiful, modern, well-equipped huge flat at a great location, close to  the city centre for a very good price. I would definitely recommend his place for anyone!! 
->Spacious, modern apartment close to central London while away from the noise and bustle. It was great to experience this neighborhood that is more 'real' than the commercial center. It takes only about 30 mts to get to the sights. DLR from westferry station to Bank from where you can get to anywhere in central London. Also, don't miss the grapes and the mayflower. Lovely pubs. Richard and his friend Seb were very easy to communicate with and promptly responded to any questions. Highly recommended.
