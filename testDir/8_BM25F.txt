->Clean and tidy. Good location
->Although this apartment is two floors above a street just off Brick Lane, it's really pretty quiet as Fashion Street itself is narrow with little traffic. The most we heard were the guys delivering food on bikes, who hang out next door in their breaks.<br/>We didn't like the fact that the main bathroom door doesn't fully close (though it's manageable. What we really DID appreciate was something that doesn't feature in the listing - the little outdoor seating area! The view's not great, but it was a lovely surprise to find it.<br/>We would probably go back on another trip to London.

REVIEWS:

->The accommodation check in process was easy, and the location was great (10/10). Unfortunately the accommodation itself was not that good. The entrance to the accommodation looks you’re entering the slums of Mumbai. Once inside, the living room was of a nice standard but wasn’t clean, with stains and dust everywhere. The TV also wasn’t working. Only one shower out of the two was working, and both showers were actually dirty and were blocked. The one shower that worked would cut the hot water off after 2 minutes use (I suspect because the owner wants to limit how much hot water we use!) The biggest issue we had was two people in the party didn’t have any duvets for sleeping because we couldn’t find the linens for the sofa beds, and so had to use the towels as blankets! (Turns out the owner keeps the linens hidden somewhere in the sofa and claims he explains where these are in an ‘apartment guide’ that we weren’t told about and I don’t think exists!). <br/>Overall, for the amount we spent the accommodation was ok, but be prepared for most things not to work or for things to be dirty.
->The Host Was, Amazing
->Clean and well furnished apartment <br/>Good communication from host
->Blinds broken in bedroom letting light in. Tv doesn’t work due to bad signal. Shower in en suite cold. Toilet seat in en suite broken. Good communication and check in details from host
->shops, food, drinks local
->Great location and value for money, some small issues with one shower not turning on but apart from that great! Would stay again :)
->Host has disappointing behaviour and poor response time
->We enjoyed our stay, lovely little apartment with a spacious living room. Great location and good value for money. Parking very close which was reasonably priced too.
->nice clean spacious apartment right in the middle of Shoreditch.  Good find, thanks!
->This apartment was just what we needed (essentially a crash pad for four of us after a night out in Shoreditch) - great location, plenty big enough for us, comfy beds and two bathrooms. Check-in procedure and communication was very good.

->Appartement équipé, fonctionnel et calme, on s'y sent tout de suite comme à la maison! Très bien situé à pied, en métro ou bus.
->Fabulous
->Myself & a work colleague stayed at Amit’s apartment for a one night business trip - it is brilliantly situated for the City & is just a few hundred metres from Aldgate East tube station. Amit was a brilliant host, providing great communication & thorough & helpful instructions. The apartment is spacious & spotlessly clean. It is stylish with nice touches that set it apart from some of the more ‘bland’ places & it was very easy to feel at home. The two bathrooms meant that myself & my colleague had our own spaces and privacy. There were toiletries in the bathroom cabinets, which was fantastic as I forgot my shower gel! I would definitely recommend staying here, the rooms are genuine doubles so the apartment could easily accommodate 6. I will almost certainly stay again!
->Beautiful, clean apartment, host is very quick to respond and thoughtful, great location with links to London literally minutes away. Perfect experience.
->Amit and his flat were amazing. The location is wonderful and the space was fresh and clean. Beds were comfortable with lots of room. Even before we arrived he was clear and communicated well and quickly. More than anything, he was so accommodating to our travels.

The area is not so great but close to bus stops.
->Many halal places to eat nearby as the population nearby is mostly of Bangladesh people. Many sweet shops and street vendors near by on the busy white chapel road.

->Great location & host
->Great apartment at a top location
->Great roomy apartment, lovely and clean. Great location with loads to do locally. If you are looking for a quiet apartment this might not be for you as on Saturday night it was quite noisy into the small hours, closing the windows did block out a lot of the noise though. 
->This is a great location and starting point for your stay in London.  The flat is well kept with responsive hosts and everything you need to enjoy work or play in London.
->Location very good close to the Main Street and bars/pubs. Apartment a bit worse for wear. Just needs a bit of TLC. Wardrobe wonky and looks like it’s going to fall on you , walls stained, toilet flusher not working, floors shredded and shower stained. Host did not reply to my message on the day but easy to pick up the key and staff in bell boi are friendly and answer all your questions. Overall, everything ran smoothly but I would not stay here if you are looking for a quiet nights sleep as it’s outside a bar on the Main Street and very loud even if the windows are closed (this was stated in the description) . Despite all the minor problems I would still stay here again as it’s good value for money and still modern and perfect for what I booked for. 
->Notre séjour s'est bien déroulé.<br/>Le quartier est vivant mais nous étions prévenus.<br/>Nous recommandons ce logement.

The sofa beds and beds were comfy and easy to make up. <br/>The area is super noisy so take ear plugs if you want to sleep soundly. <br/>The apartment is in an awesome area, jammed packed full of bars, restaurants and interesting people! <br/>Great value for a night in London!

->Awesome Apartment in an amazing location. Will be checking it's availability everytime I need a place to stay in London.
->Perfect communication. Well located. Great space!!
->A very nice Flat
->The location of this apartment is great for a stay in London and there is lots of bars etc very close by. The apartment is spacious and was ideal for a group of 8 for one night. We weren't pleased with there being a strong smell of sick in one of the bedrooms and some mould in the other bedroom and a few other things. However, I wouldn't not recommend staying here as they are things that could easily be sorted.
->The place is located in one of the many beautiful and artsy places in london. It is pretty close to everything if you uber, and has public transportation near by. When comes to the place, when we stayed one of the rooms was smelly and the problem was never solved. Then the showers were very inconsistent one day they worked the other they did not.
->A great, modern and clean apartment in a great location for exploring Shoreditch and the surrounding areas. Check-in was simple, communication between myself and the host was efficient and quick. Would definitely recommend and would stay again.
->A great place to stay in a great area, I would highly recommend. 
->Booked this for a pre-wedding get together for a group of friends: the location of the flat was amazing and perfect for a one night stay to access nearby nightlife and fun stuff nearby on each of the days. Living room sleeping was pretty noisy for those on the sofa beds but, to be fair, the listing did mention that! The separate bedrooms were great though and really nice shower/bathroom facilities. We didn't use the kitchen on this stay but there were decent looking facilities and a large table.
->The apartment is beautiful, very nice, clean and with views from the neighbourhood. I went with a group of students and they really loved the place and the location of the apartment. Really good! The check in and check out were easy and very simple. 
->Perfect for an affordable place to sleep at night, the beds were comfy. Hot tap in the en suite shower was broken which was a nuesance as there were 8 of us that wanted showers every night but the shower in the main bathroom that worked was lovely! <br/>There was already an array of essentials in the kitchen, coffee tea sugar jam salt spices etc. <br/>The washing machine door was broken so we couldn't use it but there is a dishwasher which saved us doing the washing up!!<br/>All in all, it was a pleasant stay :-)

->Highly recommend. Lovely flat to a very high standard. Would book again.
->Let me make this clear to everyone that is thinking of coming to this place it’s a PARTY BLOCK straight drinking and party vibes only do not think your going to get an easy sleep here! Right by Shoreditch overground so easy to get to Central grate cocktail bars right outside your door.
->Had a great stay here, easy contactless check in & check out- overall a good place to stay with quick access to the tube
->The place is huge and spacious for 4 guests as there are two bed rooms w huge beds. However, with more people staying. Others have to sleep on the couch. <br/>The overall living room area is very spacious and comfortable. Really loved it. <br/>The toilets and showers are pretty great as well. Except the shower in the master bedroom does not have a door to it and water splashes out. The shower head can also be replaced for more comfort.<br/>However, an overall great place to stay.
->I would like a refund please the apartment was disgusting. Stains on the walls. There was stains on the chairs. The bed wasn’t done properly. Water on the floor..
->An excellent place to stay, located very centrally in shoreditch, would 100% recommend and will definitely be returning!
->Great location and the flat was spacious.
->Mihaly was an excellent host, communication was great and the location is in a beautiful place next to various restaurants and bars. Definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay in London!
->Definitely would stay again, really good location and Mihaly was very helpful. 100% would recommend
->My colleague and I stayed at Mihaly's wonderful Airbnb as we were working nearby. It was the ideal location, right amongst the action and a short walk from the station, plus plenty of restaurants, bars and shops - you're practically on top of Boxpark!<br/>The flat was clean and towels were provided. Check-in was easy, and Mihaly was speedy with responses.<br/>The accommodation was great value for money in comparison to the other Airbnb's in the area, even those that aren't as centrally located. <br/>Thanks for having us Mihaly!

->John's place was wonderful, closer than we expected it to be, to what we need. Extremely comfortable, and well decorated,  we would have stayed longer if the place was still available 
->This is the first time we've used airbnb and I can't see how it could of been a better experience, about 5 minutes after registering I was talking to John on the phone, with all the details done and dusted. I felt like I was chatting with a long lost brother! John met us at the flat which was absolutely as advertised if not better,it was warm and comfortable with an easy walk to DLR and Westfield shopping centre. The flat had everything you could need including secure private parking, there were lovely views across the canal and the Olympic park. There's lots of stylish glass walls in kitchen/siting room area, so the only thing I would bring next time is my dressing gown so that I don't frighten any canal walkers whilst making tea first thing in the morning.
->Great host. Great place. Highly recommendable. 
->John's place was perfect... We felt really comfortable; The beds were great. John was really helpful with giving advice for getting around London and even offered us a late check out. A great host. I would highly recommend his place. Thanks John.<br/>Rob
->We were 3 persons with disability,<br/>Nice view with clean flat and thanks John for the shower chair .<br/>Very far from the center we used to pay the cap 35-40£ in each way .<br/>One of the two bathrooms was under repairing for two days .. There was a problem in the heater we had cold showers  ..<br/>The cleaner(Sevetlana) came in to the flat with out a permition when we were out .. Then John send me a long message saying Sevetlana didn't found the bins while it was in the other room and there was a broken chair in the main room and I said it was already broken when we arrived .. I didn't like the way of checking . After a week from the check out John send me a bill to pay for a blocked sink that I don't know any thing about it . 
->We stayed at John's fabulous flat for my daughter's birthday with 4 of her friends. We had an amazing time - the flat is fantastic, really luxurious, spotlessly clean, lovely décor - the pictures do not do justice! John was a great host, really quick to respond and very helpful, even organising a taxi for us with a singing cabbie! Thanks for a great stay, we'll be back!  
->Fantastic place in an amazing location. Apartment was extremely clean with fabulous views across the Olympic park. John as very easy to deal with and always quick to respond.  Would definitely stay here again and recommend - thanks John it was perfect 
->John var väldigt trevlig och tillmötesgående. Har ansträngt sig för att ge en bra upplevelse och gav många bra tips och råd om området  och vad som fanns att se och göra. Lägenheten fungerade fint för våra behov. Väldigt ljus och fräsch med fin utsikt i ett intressant område. 
->Great apartment with beautiful views of the river and and across the Olympic park. Apartment was just as listed, clean and easily accessed from Stratford station. John was always quick to respond and easy to deal with, a great host. Would recommend this apartment.
