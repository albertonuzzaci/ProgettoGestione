->Though we didn’t have the chance to meet Christina, she was super fast with the responses and super helpful with all we need. Her Flatmates are amazing people, easy going and as well, very helpful with every we needed. The room is quite big and very comfortable. We loved that they let us use all the amenities in the kitchen, so we cooked our own breakfast and dinner. In summary, we totally recommended this Airbnb (we liked so much that we booked a couple more nights!), Christina and her Flatmates are great, so don’t hesitate to book it!

->Amazing, fun and chilled environent. Clean, great bed and coffee and tea offered. Natasha was great for a chat and went beyond to make me feel at home.
->A cosy, comfy single room in a warm, welcoming household.<br/>This room is a gem of a find in a very expensive part of London. There’s desk space to work and a comfy single bed. If you’re travelling solo for business or just fun this is a perfect space that will allow you to stay in a really trendy London borough on a budget.<br/>Natasha was just the loveliest host - a fabulous communicator, she even allowed me to check in a little early. Everything was freshly cleaned and laundered in the room and I had a clean towel provided. I was given a cup of tea on arrival and even invited to share dinner! The bathroom is shared but there was a great shower and plenty of hot water.<br/>You should be aware that some of the household smoke - there was no smell in the room - so if you are super-sensitive to that then this may not be the place for you. I’m a non-smoker and it didn’t bother me.<br/>I would definitely use Natasha again if I’m in this part of London.

->Natasha is a very friendly bubbly girl,  excellent  communication , the room in her house was clean and tidy and convenient  for my purpose  as i was going to see a band at the kentish town forum which was a 15 mins walk away, would stay again if i was coming to the area in the future

->Very helpful and considerate hosts. Excellent place to stay.
->very good communication with the guests. Tank you.<br/>Bedroom and bathroom clean.<br/>
->Melanie and Peter are very accomodating hosts.  The location is perfect for exploring all that Farringdon has to offer, I highly recommend a walk down to St. John's for lunch or dinner or even just to pick up some bread and an eccles cake!  
->Peter was a very affable host. The location could not be more convenient for Farringdon/Clerkenwell and "Midtown". Room is big and breakfast is provided. After a feeling slightly worse for wear in the morning I was grateful for a big jug of milk and that I did not need to consider other flatmates potential needs.
->This was my first use of Airbnb and it all went smoothly. Queries in advance were responded to extremely promptly by Peter. Melanie was very welcoming and showed me around. The room was clean and spacious, and I was left to myself. A bit of the rumble of the city outside, but hey, you're in Central London...it's to be expected. All round, a very good experience.
->We spent a really pleasant night and would recommend peter's room for sure. 
->We  only stayed one night in Melanies apartment while we waited for a connecting flight to San Francisco.  The room was spacious and she was helpful in directing us where to go for a drink and dinner.

->I had a really lovely 6 night stay here. Shiri is a very lovely host who is up for good conversation, advice and recommendations, but also very much able to provide you with privacy, depending on your needs. Shiri was there to meet me when I arrived to show me the space, and was very prompt in addressing my needs. The room is cosy and was perfect for me, as I was mostly out during the day and very happy to head back to a comfortable bed and space to call my own. The location is fantastic - 10 mins walk to Kentish Town, Tufnell Park and Gospel Oak stations, and a bus stop just outside with buses that can take you to central London. There is a Sainsburys at the entrance of both Kentish Town and Tufnell Park stations which was perfect for me to grab anything I needed on my way back. I would definitely recommend this space!

->The room is very comfortable and the apartment is located in Northwest London but fairly central to the City and the West End.<br/>Shiri was  very accommodating in terms of my unusual early arrival & late departure.  She’s also very friendly and helpful.<br/>Rates are reasonably priced and correct for Airbnb, unlike most other hosts in London who seem to be charging hotel rates which defies the whole object of Airbnb.

->Paul is really generous and very kind. I had a very late check-in almost midnite and in between it keeps delaying and Paul seems not irritated and cool with it. The place is really close to KingCross St Prancras. Once you know the shortcut it will be about 5 minutes walk. Once arrived, called Paul, see him in person, very friendly and nice guy. The unit is very nice with modern interior design. He welcome me with beers and help to carry the baggage to 2nd floor. He introduced me his mother-in-law, gf and room mates. He prepared the guides, wifi and given the keys. The area is gated environment. I've walked back at midnite and there's no worries on the neighborhood. The listings description is very accurate. Very fast internet approx 30mbps. You able to use washing machines. You can grab yourself anything you like in the fridge.  Paul prepared me a foamburst body wash which is very cool. You must try it. This is my first time using airbnb service and I am very glad that I had chosen to stay in Paul's unit. 
->We needed a clean affordable place for a night near to St Pancras/King's Cross station. Paul's place checked all our boxes. <br/>We also sent Paul an urgent message a day before arriving asking if towels will be provided and we're really happy that it was and he included shower gel too. How thoughtful! <br/>We didn't meet Paul but met the other guests. We're well taken care off.<br/>Overall, we concur with everybody's review and really happy we stayed here
->Paul was an excellent host very friendly, accommodating and ensured there was breakfast and beer available for guests. Whilst I don't drink the very fact that Paul went the extra mile to make you feel at home was great. I cannot say enough about his hospitality he even made sure my car was secure by directing me to a visitors space in his complex. The property is an excellent location very central and close to King Cross, Camden and within easy access to the West End. Overall I have no hesitation in recommending you book a stay at Paul's place you will not be disappointed. Great host.  
->Paul was an amazing host, very friendly, accommodating. He ensured breakfast was available, and beers always fresh. I was happy to talk about trips, music or London places to visit with him. <br/><br/>Overall I strongly recommend you book a stay at Paul's place. The best host ever !<br/>
->This was my second stay with Paul, and once again I enjoyed being there.  The location is super convenient fro the Kings Cross-St Pancras hub; shopping areas are nearby; and the house is wonderful.  Paul is an excellent host, ready to share chat and a drink if you want, but will leave you be if you want when he's around.  Breakfast materials are abundant!  The large double has a table and chairs perfect for using a laptop, and a very big closet, so storage is no problem.  Paul is a living compendium of Whoviana--ask him anything about the program!  I will definitely stay with Paul on future trips.
->Paul was an awesome host! He was very kind and very helpfull. The appartment was very clean and in a quiet neighborhood. Very close of Kings Cross/St. Pancras (Eurostar) and the other attractions of the city. We definitely recommend this room for a trip in the beautiful London city.

->Annamarie is a great host. The room was clean and just what I needed. Very central to the tube station. Would definitely stay with Annamarie again.
->Beautiful apartment, exactly as pictured. Annamarie is sweet and welcoming, and had great stories and tips about the area.  Felt clean and safe as well. <br/>Great location! Just a block or so outside of the touristy bustle of central Camden, so it's quiet and a residential neighborhood but less than a 5 minute walk to tons of great locations, and super close to many bus and underground stops. Can get to any tourist attraction within 20 minutes. <br/>Would definitely stay here again! Thanks Annemarie!
->Annamaria's home will immediately become your home. Higly recommended, a very pleasant and human experience, in the very heart of Camden.
->Great welcome from a very helpful and happy host, great location and communication, spotlessly clean, nice space, comfy bed, awesome!
->She was one of the best host I have ever met. The house is clean and Wolfie(the cat) is lovely. I definitley going to stay there if I come back to London.
->Annamarie is a very friendly and welcoming host who is making sure your stay will be as comfortable as possible. All rooms are colorful and bright (bed and bathroom with windows to the silent backyard) and lovely interior. Next underground is just 5 min walking (Camden Town). Her cat wolfi is also very welcoming, cute and cautious. Thank you Annamarie for making me feeling home for this short stay at beautiful London City 🙏🏼🌞
->Annamarie est très accueillante très gentille. Je suis ravie d’avoir croisé son chemin !
->Annamarie is a wonderful host. Clean and a great location to get around London with the underground just a 5 minute walk from her place. A real joy. I will be back
->Annamarie is a wonderful, warm-hearted and welcoming person. Staying here made my trip to London so great! Thanks again! Love Jasmin
->I was only at Annamarie’s place for a couple days but it was a very comfortable stay in a conveniently located neighborhood. If I was back in the city I would love to stay here again.

->Very hospitable hosts. Great value for money and is situated in a very ideal location for visiting London.
->I really enjoyed my stay (3 weeks) at Alvin's place. I will stay again with them when I am back in London and looking for my own place. <br/>You are staying with Alvin and his wife with whom you share the bathroom and the kitchen. Both of them are very kind and extremely welcoming - they even took care of my dinner on the first evening when all shops were closed. I always felt that I could join them in the living room in the evenings. <br/>The room is rather small but well equipped with bed, desk (not on the pictures), dresser, and wardrobe. The window is towards a mildly busy street, which might be a problem during the night. When working from home, I did not mind too much as the street noise provided a nice background sound. <br/>The kitchen is very well equipped, and you are free to use the equipment for preparing your meals. If you are lucky, you are even treated to dinner or lunch or some snack in the afternoon.<br/>The location of the flat is great; it is a 5 min walk away from the Northern line (Mornington Crescent) and a good 10min walk away from Kings Cross. If you are coming from Heathrow, I do recommend taking the Picadilly line to Kings Cross and walking the last bit as changing from Picadilly line to Northern line at Leicester Square involves several stairs (as well as your end station Mornington Crescent). The canal is only 5 min away and Camden Market less than 10 min. Very close to the flat is a Santander bike-for-hire station which is very convenient to get around London without using the tube. <br/>Thank you Alvin for the very nice stay and see you soon!
->Great place and hosts. The room is perfect space and cozy, and Alvin and his partner make sure you feel home and have everything you need. It's also very well located and quiet!! Would definitely come back!
->Me ha parecido todo muy correcto tanto el emplazamiento ,como la ubicación así como el trato con Alvin y Dasma.La habitación es grande y con todo lo que se pueda necesitar.<br/>No hay nada negativo o algo que me haya molestado lo suficiente para comentar
->a great location and the hosts are friendly and accommodating
->Just a quick overnight stay at Alvin’s as I was down in London for work. The room was exactly as described, clean, and the bed comfy.  I would definitely recommend it for someone looking for an very good value place to stay that is pretty central to most of what London can offer
->I stayed two weeks at Alvin's apartment and the 14 days were great! He and his wife Nasma made me feel less homesick and were helpful with everything that I needed. They are the perfect hosts. A very respectful couple. I felt really comfortable in their place and I now know where I can stay in London next time. Also, the apartment is very well located in Camden. Shops, restaurants, bars, cafes and Camden station are only a stone's throw away. I highly recommend them!
->Lovely couple. Flat in excellent location close to amenities and transport links. Room really big with the most comfortable mattress ever. Very helpful with communication and answering questions. I would stay again and highly recommend to others.
->All good. Recommended
->Cet appartement est idéal pour un petit séjour à Londres car proche de la gare, de Camden Town et des autres métros.<br/>La communication était facile et rapide avec Alvin et sa compagne. Ils m’ont très bien accueillis et je n’ai manqué de rien !<br/>Merci encore, <br/>Je reviendrais sans hésiter 😊

->Felicia was a very nice and welcoming host. She waited for me until late evening the first night I arrived late due to my working concerns.
->This stay was excellent. Felicia and myself ended up having lots of shared passions. In addition, the flat was optimally located. I will come back :)
->Felicia was very welcoming and kind! She offered to describe things to do in the area and help me figure out the tube, as I'm not from London! The house is in a central part of Kentish town , close to shops and restaurants and is within walking distance to the Camden Markets, which you should definitely go check out if you stay here! Felicia's house is clean and cute! The terrace is a nice little bonus! The only complaint I have is the bed. It was very thin and a little uncomfortable, however for me, this is not the priority. I would definitely stay here again!
->Stayed one night. Was perfect, clean, close to the transport links. Felicia was a great host and very welcoming. Would stay again! Thank you!
->I really enjoyed my stay here, spacious room with comfy double bed, perfect for what I needed. Great location with plenty of shops nearby. Great host, very welcoming, will book again.

->Chambre confortable et pas trop cher à moins de 10 mins à pied de Camden Market et ses boutique ainsi que de plusieurs transport en commun. <br/>Hôte très agreable.<br/>
->Lovely room with a good amount of space and a relaxing place to be.  Felicia was most accommodating and quick to answer any questions. The location was good as there are several tube stations near by within a 10min walk, supermarket near by and very close to the town centre with restaurants and pubs.  I would definitely stay again. Thank you 
->I had a great time at Felicia's. The house was clean and cosy, and communication with Felicia was easy. Fantastic value for money.
->The location is great and the room very spacious. It was a pleasant stay at the end of my trip for me to relax.

->I booked Natasha’s AirBnB for my sister, who was visiting and needed somewhere quiet to sleep. I live in Kentish Town but on a main road, which is very noisy. I was already familiar with the road that Natasha’s place is on. It’s quiet but close to public transport, well-lit and very safe to walk at night. <br/>All communication with Natasha was excellent. She was friendly, quick to respond to messages, and the booking confirmation was speedy and smooth. She explained the breakfast options and even offered to procure different milk if needed. My sister wrote the following review: <br/>“I found my 3 night stay at Natasha's home very pleasant. Natasha was friendly and welcoming, her home is very beautiful and well maintained. The room was immaculate, bright and airy and the double bed very comfortable. Natasha provided home- made cereal and yogurt for breakfast and I could help myself to tea/coffee etc. The bathroom has a great shower and mini toiletries and a towel were provided. A lovely quiet location, great for a good night’s sleep.” (Vicky Booth) <br/>Thanks again Natasha! 😊<br/>  <br/>

->Natasha is a really nice girl and her place is super. It is very close to the subway and also the main street with a variety of shops and restaurants! I definitely recommend this place! It is very clean and you will really feel like you are at your friend’s :))  Thank you Natahsha!!
->My stay at Natasha's place was perfect. She made me feel so comfortable, at home and like a friend. She went above and beyond - making me cups of tea and coffee, offering her space and her food generously (though it was not expected and included). I would definitely recommend her place to someone young and new to the city (like me!) who wants to know this best veggie spots.
->Natasha was a great host, really thoughtful and accommodating. I really enjoyed my time and would definitely recommend to everyone!
->A lovely thoughtful host. Very friendly and helpful too. Her home is beautiful! Would definitely go back and stay there.
->What a gorgeous home Natasha has, lovely touches, with an offer of breakfast. The neighbourhood is gorgeous, and despite its closeness to the bustle of Camdem seems a world away, with its leafy streets and suburban chill. <br/>Natasha was easy to communicate to and made herself available on arrival and departure. Easy chat and a long time resident if the area. Great stay!
->A lovely private room to sleep in and very clean! Stayed for 2 nights, wished I stayed longer. Natasha is easy-going and she takes care of her guests. The town is a great place to check-out with many cafes serving good coffee. Easy to navigate and walking distance to the high street where you can catch a bus or walk to the nearby tubes.
->Natasha is such a lovely and welcoming host. Her flat is beautiful and the attic room is spacious, airy and super comfortable. This definitely feels like a home away from home and Natasha made it all so easy. Highly recommended!
->Natasha was the best airbnb host I’ve ever met! She was very friendly and helpful, made me feel very welcoming and comfortable. The house was super clean and cozy with lovely decorations and a big comfy bed in the looftop room. The breakfast was included and she gave me vegan granola, soy milk, soya yogurts and fruits and coffee :)

->Rachel's flat is just like she advertised it.<br/>It's in an amazing location, in a very lively area with great public transportation.<br/>The flat is big, well equipped and decorated.<br/>Rachel is great - she will make you feel at home. Dougie is super friendly and well-behaved.<br/>Would definitely recommend the place!
->Rachel and Dougie (her dog) were awesome hosts!<br/>We spent a weekend in London and booked her apartment. The good communication showed even before we arrived: Rachel was very easy to get in touch with and helpful with a lot of tips. She informed us that we would have the apartment to ourselves, which course was very nice (sharing it with dougie was just another big plus).<br/>We met Rachel the evening before we left and it was another pleasant surprise: a very easygoing and helpful host! <br/>All in all the apartment was just what we needed and very nice, with an easy connection to all of the transport options! We felt very welcome and would recommend this Airbnb for sure!<br/>Thank you so much for having us Rachel and Dougie! Hope to see you again! <br/>Cath & Sidsel
->Rachel's Camden flat was perfectly suited to the needs of any short term stay. She was highly communicative and welcoming, and her dog, Dougie, was the cutest, most well behaved pooch you could hope to come across. The room was bright and airy and didn't feel cramped for my husband and I to stay in together. <br/>The location is absolutely incredible! You are just across from Camden overground and a few minutes walk from Camden tube station, so getting in and out is incredibly simple, even if you're arriving by rail. You might not even want to leave Camden, as her place is situated in the center of this iconic neighborhood with more than enough markets, bars, pubs, restaurants and events to keep you busy for a while. <br/>I whole-heartedly recommend this for anyone wanting a little London getaway with a friendly host.
->The best AirBNB experience. Rachel is a fantastic host. She was very attentive to all my questions and made sure I had a comfortable stay. She also gave me a list of activities and recommendations I could do, which I very much appreciated.<br/> The location was great. It’s literally a 5 minute walk to the tube station, and a couple of minutes walk to St. Pancras.<br/>The apartment is very stylish and cosy and had a fantastic outdoor space. The bed was comfortable. <br/>Rachel's dog was the highlight of my trip - he is the cutest dog ever.<br/>Overall totally recommend it! 5 stars stay.
->Staying with Rachel and Dougie Fresh (her adorable Puggle) in Camden was a great experience!  Rachel and Dougie made us feel very comfortable and at home in the flat! She's a great host - very flexible and welcoming.  The communication was smooth, and she ensured that we had everything we needed. The flat is very clean and well put together, and the room is great with a comfy bed.  I particularly loved the effort put into the decor of the flat and very much enjoyed the artwork she's collected.  The kitchen is well equipped if you want to do a bit of cooking, and there's a fantastic outdoor space to enjoy a glass of wine. The flat is well located and very close to public transport (underground and overground) - making it super easy to get around. There's some nice bars and restaurants to explore around the flat as well, making this a great choice for a short stay.  Dougie was obviously the star of the flat - very well behaved and so, so cute.  I would definitely recommend staying with Rachel if you're in London!
->Great room with a really comfy bed. Dougie Fresh really is the cherry on top of this place he’s such a sound dog love that guy and hope to see him soon 5/5 would boop again.
->This was our second time staying in Rachel’s lovely Camden flat, and we couldn’t be happier! <br/>We were greeted once again by the lovely Dougie Fresh, aka the cutest, fuzziest host on AirBnB. <br/>Rachel was highly communicative and despite having a busy schedule, prioritized our check in and out and made sure everything was a breeze. <br/>My husband and I were just as happy this time around with the bright and airy accommodations and incredibly central location. We whole heartedly recommend Rachel’s place for anyone needing a short term stay in a great location, perfectly situated for travel around the city.
->Rachel was an absolute peach of a host! Made checking in super easy, gave loads or recommendations of things to do and see in Camden and in nearby neighborhoods. Oh and her pup Dougie pulled out all of the stops to welcome us when we arrived. 10/10 would stay again!
->Amazing stay, comfortable and in a fantastic location. Rachel and Dougie are an asset! I highly recommend it.
->We really had the best time at Rachel‘s. We loved the host (incl. Dougie ;)), the place and the area! It didn‘t bother us but the only thing is that the room is next to the railway so if you have a light sleep this might disturb. Everything you need is right around the corner

->Carlos was lovely in arranging everything for my arrival. I had to get there early in the morning and he organised everything accordingly, for me to find the room ready and the keys. I was also able to leave my luggage there until the following evening when I had to leave quite late, without having to check out. The room is lovely, the bed is comfortable, and the location is perfect.
->I had a lovely two days stay at Carlos' place. The area couldn't be more perfect. You're right around the corner from the British Museum. The room itself is lovely and the shower is wonderful. I would definitely come back again.
