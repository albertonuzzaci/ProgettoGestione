Though we didn‚Äôt have the chance to meet Christina, she was super fast with the responses and super helpful with all we need. Her Flatmates are amazing people, easy going and as well, very helpful with every we needed. The room is quite big and very comfortable. We loved that they let us use all the amenities in the kitchen, so we cooked our own breakfast and dinner. In summary, we totally recommended this Airbnb (we liked so much that we booked a couple more nights!), Christina and her Flatmates are great, so don‚Äôt hesitate to book it!
Friendly & helpful hosts
Great room, little cozy garden in the back and at literally 2 minutes from groceries, tube and overground. Very easy going flatmates!

Annamarie is a great host. The room was clean and just what I needed. Very central to the tube station. Would definitely stay with Annamarie again.
Beautiful apartment, exactly as pictured. Annamarie is sweet and welcoming, and had great stories and tips about the area.  Felt clean and safe as well. <br/>Great location! Just a block or so outside of the touristy bustle of central Camden, so it's quiet and a residential neighborhood but less than a 5 minute walk to tons of great locations, and super close to many bus and underground stops. Can get to any tourist attraction within 20 minutes. <br/>Would definitely stay here again! Thanks Annemarie!
Annamaria's home will immediately become your home. Higly recommended, a very pleasant and human experience, in the very heart of Camden.
Great welcome from a very helpful and happy host, great location and communication, spotlessly clean, nice space, comfy bed, awesome!
She was one of the best host I have ever met. The house is clean and Wolfie(the cat) is lovely. I definitley going to stay there if I come back to London.
Annamarie is a very friendly and welcoming host who is making sure your stay will be as comfortable as possible. All rooms are colorful and bright (bed and bathroom with windows to the silent backyard) and lovely interior. Next underground is just 5 min walking (Camden Town).

Eventhough we didn't get to meet the couple, I'm sure they're lovely. We checked in around midnight and left the next day when they when they were already back at work.

Good location and pleasant host.... only there a night but was perfect for my needs.
Very warm welcome and lovely room. Great location near Hampstead Heath.
Jennifer and her partner are two fabulous hosts: kind and willing to give information and support. The house is pretty, clean and located in a very nice area, close to Hampstead Heath and well connected by public transport. I would recommend any friend to stay there!
Good people, good place, nothing to add !:)
lovely room, nice host and v adorable animals
Our weekend at Jennifer and her husband's place was fantastic! Jennifer was answering all questions before we arrive, and both are very kind people, it was great to be hosted like this! The flat is very convenient, a lot of buses + the metro going all day and night long in the city, and the area is cute and chill. The flat has everything needed and is clean, and their 3 cats and the dog are all very kind animals. It was a pleasure to be hosted there and I definitely recommand them! Thanks to you guys again ;)
Jennifer and Richard are very nice host. We received a warm welcoming and good attraction suggestion from them. The location is good where you can find buses/underground easily. The animals are really adorable! We had a great time with them during the stay.Highly recommend:):).
Our stay at Jenny's was great. Nice cosy room in a very lovely location, very close to the best park of London, Hampstead Heath.

Very helpful and considerate hosts. Excellent place to stay.
very good communication with the guests. Tank you.<br/>Bedroom and bathroom clean.<br/>
Melanie and Peter are very accomodating hosts.  The location is perfect for exploring all that Farringdon has to offer, I highly recommend a walk down to St. John's for lunch or dinner or even just to pick up some bread and an eccles cake!  
Peter was a very affable host. The location could not be more convenient for Farringdon/Clerkenwell and "Midtown". Room is big and breakfast is provided. After a feeling slightly worse for wear in the morning I was grateful for a big jug of milk and that I did not need to consider other flatmates potential needs.
This was my first use of Airbnb and it all went smoothly. Queries in advance were responded to extremely promptly by Peter. Melanie was very welcoming and showed me around. The room was clean and spacious, and I was left to myself. A bit of the rumble of the city outside, but hey, you're in Central London...it's to be expected. All round, a very good experience.
We spent a really pleasant night and would recommend peter's room for sure. 
We  only stayed one night in Melanies apartment while we waited for a connecting flight to San Francisco.  The room was spacious and she was helpful in directing us where to go for a drink and dinner.
host is kind and clean and big room.
Melanie was very kind to help me with my luggage even though I arrived early on Sunday morning. <br/>Location was fantastic and extremely safe. <br/>

Felicia was a very nice and welcoming host. She waited for me until late evening the first night I arrived late due to my working concerns.
This stay was excellent. Felicia and myself ended up having lots of shared passions. In addition, the flat was optimally located. I will come back :)
Felicia was very welcoming and kind! She offered to describe things to do in the area and help me figure out the tube, as I'm not from London! The house is in a central part of Kentish town , close to shops and restaurants and is within walking distance to the Camden Markets, which you should definitely go check out if you stay here! Felicia's house is clean and cute! The terrace is a nice little bonus! The only complaint I have is the bed. It was very thin and a little uncomfortable, however for me, this is not the priority. I would definitely stay here again!
Stayed one night. Was perfect, clean, close to the transport links. Felicia was a great host and very welcoming. Would stay again! Thank you!
I really enjoyed my stay here, spacious room with comfy double bed, perfect for what I needed. Great location with plenty of shops nearby. Great host, very welcoming, will book again.

Everything was freshly cleaned and laundered in the room and I had a clean towel provided. I was given a cup of tea on arrival and even invited to share dinner! The bathroom is shared but there was a great shower and plenty of hot water.<br/>You should be aware that some of the household smoke - there was no smell in the room - so if you are super-sensitive to that then this may not be the place for you. I‚Äôm a non-smoker and it didn‚Äôt bother me.<br/>I would definitely use Natasha again if I‚Äôm in this part of London.
Natasha and her housemates are lovely and very welcoming. Communication was excellent and I will definitely stay again if I‚Äôm in the area. Room was clean and comfortable.
Truely an amazing and lovely host. Natasha drove me to a pharmacy for a migraine, leant me a jacket for the cold and was just so friendly and her girls were so kind and helpful too (asking if I wanted anything from the shop etc!) the room was so cosy too. I really enjoyed my stay here.
Natasha is a very friendly bubbly girl,  excellent  communication , the room in her house was clean and tidy and convenient  for my purpose  as i was going to see a band at the kentish town forum which was a 15 mins walk away, would stay again if i was coming to the area in the future
Natasha is an absolute gem and the room is a 'does what it says on the tin' job. Highly recommend.

Convenient location, pleasant stay, reasonable price, and oh, good cup of coffee. I enjoyed breakfast in the backyard. Paul is a good host.
Paul has been super welcoming and so nice. He had a beer and martini upon arrival and stay up chatting straight away. The place has a great outdoor area which is nice to sit in the sun, weather permitting. Location is so central you couldn't get much better. While it's not a 5 star hotel, it is definitely clean and with a relaxed home environment. You can chill out privately or have a chat with Paul, or even sit around and watch TV. Highly recommend this place to anyone! Paul was a great host!!
We had a great stay at Paul's place during our shopping spree in London. The communication lines are perfect with the buss to Camden Market just around the corner and both the underground and hop-on-hop-off busses leaving from Kings Cross. A nice breakfast in the morning and then off. Even though his house is near St Pancras Station it is a very quite neighbourhood. Despite the wether being cold and mostly rainy we spent saturday night on the patio drinking wine. Must be a really lovely place in summer! We were not that impressed by the hygiene standards, but hope Paul will take care off that after he has the reconstruction done. It would be nice to come back there!
Paul was very nice and accommodating, even offering me a beverage upon arrival. The room was nice, with room closely located. I'd stay again!<br/><br/>
Paul was a great host. Very accommodating with our busy and tight schedule.
Paul was very welcoming. Even if there was a bit of dust because of the building work, the place was nice and calm, just near St pancras and we had all the things we need for breakfast. Thanks for this great moment!
Paul is a great host, welcoming and easygoing. The apartment was coherent with the description and very well located. The neighborhood was quiet and clean.<br/>Will definitely come back here next time!
Paul is a fantastic host! His place is incredibly comfortable and the location is the best, super central but also quiet. The apartment itself is beautifully renovated and very spacious (some people say cosy when they actually mean small but that is not the case here). The room easily fits two and has ample wardrobe space and lots of light from the large window. Great breakfast, good company and unlimited beer. What could be better?
My daughter and I had a fantastic stay here last week. Paul is a superb, friendly host, and made us feel extremely welcome, comfortable and relaxed. His home is absolutely lovely and has a terrific ambience.. bright, warm clean, great shower, comfortable bed, ample space. The pinball machine is wicked!! the underfloor heating divine!!

Had a wonderful stay at Albert‚Äôs flat during the holiday season. Check-in was easy and flexible (Albert was very helpful with instructions & working with my schedule).  Unfortunately, we never met in person, but he demonstrated great hospitality. For example, Albert was quick to respond if I had any questions and made sure my stay was as relaxing as possible. In terms of the space itself, the room was very clean with a shared bathroom with the other housemates. The kitchen is fully equipped which made it possible to cook a good meal. There are two cats as mentioned in the advertisement - they‚Äôre friendly most of the time & did not cause any issues. If you are I familiar with the area, Hampstead is a wonderful neighborhood in North London, and it‚Äôs very safe and quiet. My favourite thing about staying in Hampstead is the proximity to green spaces (e.g. Hampstead Heath & Primrose Hill/Regent Park) - perfect place to stay if you‚Äôre a runner like me!  Furthermore, the flat is near city bus stations and a ~12min walk to the Underground (Jubilee line, which easily takes you to the central & other lines).

I had a really lovely 6 night stay here. Shiri is a very lovely host who is up for good conversation, advice and recommendations, but also very much able to provide you with privacy, depending on your needs. Shiri was there to meet me when I arrived to show me the space, and was very prompt in addressing my needs. The room is cosy and was perfect for me, as I was mostly out during the day and very happy to head back to a comfortable bed and space to call my own. The location is fantastic - 10 mins walk to Kentish Town, Tufnell Park and Gospel Oak stations, and a bus stop just outside with buses that can take you to central London. There is a Sainsburys at the entrance of both Kentish Town and Tufnell Park stations which was perfect for me to grab anything I needed on my way back. I would definitely recommend this space!

The room is very comfortable and the apartment is located in Northwest London but fairly central to the City and the West End.<br/>Shiri was  very accommodating in terms of my unusual early arrival & late departure.  She‚Äôs also very friendly and helpful.<br/>Rates are reasonably priced and correct for Airbnb, unlike most other hosts in London who seem to be charging hotel rates which defies the whole object of Airbnb.
The description is accurate as to what the host said. The convenient location and private space. The host is so kindly and hospitality and warm
Everything you need for a stay in London and a very friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Highly recommended.
perfect location absolutely ideal for exploring London  comfortable and great price with everything you need. would recommend üëå
Small apartment nicely located in Kentish Town in Camden.<br/>It‚Äôs exactly as described and Shiri is a nice and welcoming host.
Great communication with the owner and the place is really nice. Totally recommend!
Nice room in Shiris apartment. Apartment was like in description. Near to the apartment was a bus stop and around a 10-15 minute walk away was the subway. <br/>The communication with Shiri was really nice and the check-in, aswell as the check-out were really easy.
Good place.

This is a lovely house in a quiet neighbourhood near Euston, Kings Cross and the vibrant Camden Town and markets.<br/>The large bed is very comfortable.<br/>Paul, the host, is most welcoming and friendly.<br/>Thanks for the beer and tea!<br/>Highly recommended.
Paul is a perfect host for us. We asked so many requests before and after our stay. Every time he smiled and accepted our requests. Thanks to Paul, we had a great time in Europe. We strongly recommend to stay!
Paul was super welcoming and friendly.  His place is quite cool - and very centrally located and easy to get to.  Definitely recommended!  
This was my first time in London and it couldn't have been any better!!!! Paul was the perfect host, super accommodating, the location was great and even his other guest we're hospitable, overall, 10 out of 10 for me, thanks again Paul!!!
Paul is really generous and very kind. I had a very late check-in almost midnite and in between it keeps delaying and Paul seems not irritated and cool with it. The place is really close to KingCross St Prancras. Once you know the shortcut it will be about 5 minutes walk. Once arrived, called Paul, see him in person, very friendly and nice guy. The unit is very nice with modern interior design. He welcome me with beers and help to carry the baggage to 2nd floor. He introduced me his mother-in-law, gf and room mates. He prepared the guides, wifi and given the keys. The area is gated environment. I've walked back at midnite and there's no worries on the neighborhood. The listings description is very accurate. Very fast internet approx 30mbps. You able to use washing machines. You can grab yourself anything you like in the fridge.  Paul prepared me a foamburst body wash which is very cool. You must try it. This is my first time using airbnb service and I am very glad that I had chosen to stay in Paul's unit. 
We needed a clean affordable place for a night near to St Pancras/King's Cross station. Paul's place checked all our boxes. <br/>We also sent Paul an urgent message a day before arriving asking if towels will be provided and we're really happy that it was and he included shower gel too. How thoughtful! <br/>We didn't meet Paul but met the other guests. We're well taken care off.<br/>Overall, we concur with everybody's review and really happy we stayed here
Paul was an excellent host very friendly, accommodating and ensured there was breakfast and beer available for guests. Whilst I don't drink the very fact that Paul went the extra mile to make you feel at home was great. I cannot say enough about his hospitality he even made sure my car was secure by directing me to a visitors space in his complex. The property is an excellent location very central and close to King Cross, Camden and within easy access to the West End. Overall I have no hesitation in recommending you book a stay at Paul's place you will not be disappointed. Great host.  
Paul was an amazing host, very friendly, accommodating. He ensured breakfast was available, and beers always fresh. I was happy to talk about trips, music or London places to visit with him. <br/><br/>Overall I strongly recommend you book a stay at Paul's place. The best host ever !<br/>
This was my second stay with Paul, and once again I enjoyed being there.  The location is super convenient fro the Kings Cross-St Pancras hub; shopping areas are nearby; and the house is wonderful.  Paul is an excellent host, ready to share chat and a drink if you want, but will leave you be if you want when he's around.  Breakfast materials are abundant!  The large double has a table and chairs perfect for using a laptop, and a very big closet, so storage is no problem.  Paul is a living compendium of Whoviana--ask him anything about the program!  I will definitely stay with Paul on future trips.
Paul was an awesome host! He was very kind and very helpfull. The appartment was very clean and in a quiet neighborhood. Very close of Kings Cross/St. Pancras (Eurostar) and the other attractions of the city. We definitely recommend this room for a trip in the beautiful London city.

Carlos was lovely in arranging everything for my arrival. I had to get there early in the morning and he organised everything accordingly, for me to find the room ready and the keys. I was also able to leave my luggage there until the following evening when I had to leave quite late, without having to check out. The room is lovely, the bed is comfortable, and the location is perfect.
I had a lovely two days stay at Carlos' place. The area couldn't be more perfect. You're right around the corner from the British Museum. The room itself is lovely and the shower is wonderful. I would definitely come back again.

Maria's place is clean and tidy, we were really comfortable in her place, and there are plenty of places to eat, coffee shops, restaurants and supermarkets 5 minutes walk from the accomodation.  I will highly recommend Maria's place.
What a nice studio for two. Perfect for exploring -- close to the tube and the train, within walking distance from Hampstead Heath, plus the neighbourhood is lovely in itself. The studio is full of light, airy, practical, and very good value for the price. Maria was a perfect host, quick to respond, and she gave us many insider tips as to what to see. Would definitely stay again.
Cosy set up in charming west hampstead
Maria is a marvelous, talented, and responsive host. She shared so much fascinating information about her work as a musician and was so accommodating with our arrival and departure plans as well. The flat was also spotless and full of light. In addition, the queen bed is extremely comfortable and the location cannot be beat --- close to many forms of transport, wonderful cafes and shops, and a beautiful park. All the necessary conveniences are in the flat too. Wish we could have stayed longer!
Maria was a great host and we had a great stay there. The location was perfect for us. Thank you very much for everything
Maria's studio is in an excellent location close to public transport and the vibrant street life of West Hampstead with many shops, bars and restaurants.  The apartment is ideal for a couple or single and is clean, modern and light filled.  Maria is the perfect host and it's one of those places you feel so welcome and would love to stay longer.
Lovely studio area in maria ¬¥s house. Maria is an amazing host.
Great spacious studio with a super duper comfy mattress. Water pressure in shower was perfect and the little private balcony was perfect for am coffee.  Maria provided a fridge full of amenities including milk and fresh fruit.  She was very accommodating with am early check in and a late check out and easy to reach if needed and very kind and hospitable. The studio is in a great part of west Hampstead; 12min walk to Jubilee tube (which runs all night on weekends) and nearby west end Lane has loads of restaurants, cafes, good thrift shops and a sat farmers market. I would def recommend and stay here again! 
Maria‚Äôs place was very cosy, clean and welcoming. There was a lot of light which made the place look spacious. It was very clean and tidy. Maria was very quick to reply and helped me with everything I needed. I felt at home. I will definitely visit again if I am in London. 
Tutto perfetto!!!Maria √® stata veramente eccezionale; era sempre disponibile e pronta  a darci tutte le informazioni sulla citt√†.La casa era pulitissima ed attrezzatissima!Molto vicina al centro e ben servita dai  mezzi!Ci siamo sentiti veramente a casa.Chi vuole visitare Londra deve alloggiare a casa di Maria!Ci torneremo senz' altro!!

I stayed at Danya's appartment and it was exactly as stated on the post.<br/>for me it was what I was looking for.<br/>Thanks Danya
Danya was a great host! Very friendly and supportive!  Her flat was very close to public transport and in a few minutes you can reach everything! Thanks again Danya for a great time!
Danya's flat is incredibly well located, clean and tidy. She was an excellent host and provided us with all information and services we needed. Communication with her was always easy. I highly recommend her flat.
Unfortunately (for) Danya was ill,  but her welcome was still very welcome. Thanks for that Danya. She gave us a great tip to eat and made a reservation for us.   The flat was very quiet good location and bed were perfect.
Location is good. Plan on 45 to 60 minutes walking to get to major sites. Tube is within 10 minutes. Bus service not good. Need to transfer and confusing if not knowledgeable.  Walking was as fast as the bus. Overall was satisfactory. 7 out of 10. Flat was typical, small by our standards but the norm in UK. Danya was a good host.  Would stay there again.
Danya was very generous and hospitable, going out of her way to make sure we had all we needed. Her flat is very clean. She made tea for us in the evening and showed us great places to eat. My son and I felt very welcome at her place, we were lucky to find such an accomodation. Thanks Danya!
Danya went way out of her way to help us feel welcome in her home in every way possible. She is a remarkably warm and caring person.
Very good locations, close to the metro station, shops, restaurants and even pubs.<br/>Clean and tidy.<br/>But perhaps the biggest plus is Danya- warm, helpful, with a sense of humor.<br/>I'm sure that she also had something to do with the beautiful weather throughout my stay in London. <br/>Thank You.
Danya is a really nice host, she cares about your specific needs and is ready to help you with anything you would need. I would definitely recommend spending some time at her place, she can also take you out for dinner and give you some advice on what is nice to do in London. Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt spend as much time as we wanted with her but will definitely make it right next time ! 
Danya is a really nice host. Friendly and considerate. The flat is really nice too. In a good position and very clean. Hope to see her soon in the future.
