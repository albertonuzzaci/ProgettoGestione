->As a family of 4, Olga made us feel welcome for our month long stay. The flat is well laid out with 3 bedrooms. Good safe neighbourhood, just by the marina and a pleasant (shortish) walk to Canary Wharf.<br/>With its proximity to the DLR, train noise can be an issue.

->This is the perfect Airbnb. Easy to book, great communication from host and a place that exceeds expectations. We would stay again in a heartbeat. 
->Wonderful apartment. Great hosting. Everything I expected and more. Would definitely stay there again if I had he choice !
->Couldn't rate this apartment and lazer as a host highly enough! Will definitely stay again! Beautiful Veiws and a beautiful apartment.
->If you want a really clean, modern place to stay, with amazing views of the River Thames, then this is it! We really enjoyed our stay here! We consider it family friendly, although our kids are a bit older. It is very close to public transport and very secure.
->Fantastic flat, with stunning views and very close to the DLR (but not too close!). Lazer was a truly great host and checked regularly to  make sure everything was ok.
->This apartment was fantastic! It's new, clean and beautiful and is located on the Prime Meridian Line on the bank of the Thames River and across from the O2. Such a beautiful view! The closest DLR station is just a block away, as is a grocery store that had everything we needed. Lazer responded extremely quickly to any question or comment we had - before, during and after our stay. We'd love to stay here again!
->Made a great last minute holiday - the east end us like a whole new city we'd never explored and the apartment made all it really accessible. DLR so much nicer to use than the tube. The apartment gave us affordable luxury with the self catering we needed for a family. Lazer was always in the end of a phone so we didn't need to worry about s thing. The view and balcony was amazing. Big flat screen to great for the kids. Lots of fun.
->This apartment is in a fabulous location with great views of the Thames and a short walk from Canary Wharf.  The apartment was super clean and comfortable; not a cheap stay but worth it.
->Great place and location.
->The apartment was every bit as shown and described. New, clean and stylish with quality fittings.<br/>The views were spectacular ( especially from the balcony at night )  and the television offered multiple channels for a bit of relaxation at the end of the day.<br/>London is a big sprawling city ( compared to other European capitals ) so need to be mindful transportation is required for most sites, attractions and restaurants ) <br/>Communication with Lazer was excellent. This is very important when in a foreign country and a little unsure before settling in.  <br/>We very much enjoyed the apartment and would recommend to airbnb users.<br/>Dragan

->Great apartment. Very clean and well thought out. Amit a brilliant host, very responsive and helpful.
->This is a beautiful flat in a great location, especially the proximity to Brick Lane. It is clean and well maintained with plenty of room for our 5 person group. We unfortunately had an experience with the power going out in the flat for about 9 daytime hours during our 2 day stay. Amit was able to have the power restored as quickly as what was within his control as it required an engineer to come and fix. We overall enjoyed our stay!
->I can only recommend the apartment and the host! 10/10.<br/>Super convenient check-in.<br/>Clean apartment. Everything was as described.<br/>Fast internet connection.<br/>Clear and exceptionally swift communication with the host. He was really helpful whenever we had a question.<br/>This was not a real problem for us, but the internet connection was a little bit unstable upstairs as the router is located downstairs. It did work upstairs too but video calls may be a bit laggy if you are in one of the bedrooms upstairs.<br/>All in all great experience. Thank you.
->Really clean and well presented apartment. It was spacious and welcoming. Amit was easy to get in touch with and checked up on us during our stay to make sure we was ok. It is a stones throw away from the tube station. Would recommend to others looking to stay and would happily stay again if the opportunity presented itself.
->Easy checkin, very clean, host was really flexible and kind to let us check in early

Check in was simple, the kitchen was gorgeous, the host was very kind and welcoming. Our stay was incredibly comfortable and everything with the location, cleanliness, ease, etc. really made it a lovely few nights

->This was a great location for an event we were attending in Victoria Park. Amazing views across London. Super easy access to tube and Sainsbury's. We felt very safe and comfortable. An excellent spot for our family. The only thing to note is that there is no air conditioning.
->John Paul's apartment is perfectly located and absolutely spotless.  Large, spacious and bright with lots of windows and amazing views of London.  The kitchen is well equipped with everything we needed.  Very comfortable and modern, and wonderful to have free parking and Sainsbury's right underneath!  The apartment is very quiet - we didn't hear a sound from neighbours etc. Loved it! 
->Stylish apartment in a high rising complex near the Bromley Line. Good value for money and has all essentials. Make sure you're not afraid of heights because it is high up!
->Amazing place, good location.  Loved the view.
->This apartment is well positioned near Stratford in Eastern London. <br/>Very near the Bromley-by-Bow  tube station. It has a moderate sized Tesco super market within 5 minutes walk and a small Sainsbury local at the bottom of the apartment block. It has great views over London, however it is close  to a major highway which meant in a very hot summer it was super noisy 24/7.  The table and chairs were really unstable. We had to make our beds up on arrival with linen that didn’t fit. While the apartment was superficially clean we had to spend some significant time cleaning the  oven, floors, vacuum cleaner and buying and replacing light bulbs in bedside lamps. Some what poor attention to detail.

REVIEWS:

->Staying at the Penthouse was absolutely magical, such a great time. Had great communication with Janet before the arrival date and guided into the property. On check in, Janet was there to check us in and showed us everything we needed to know and explained went through the very handy manual which was very clear, detailed and easy to read, was fantastic having all the information there to hand after they had gone. <br/>Welcome pack with things like milk ect was very welcomed and the recommendations for local places to visit and eat where well appreciated. We also did order a takeaway one night and the delivery of this was smooth and no issues with them finding address. The property itself was nothing short of perfect, Beautiful views over the harbour out of the floor to ceiling windows spanning the 2 floors, plenty of outdoor space including the downstairs balcony and upstairs, very spacious terrace; perfect space for breakfast outside watching over the water. <br/>Bedrooms were so lovely and I had the best 3 nights sleep I have had in along time. The private hot tub... well, what can I say..  Amazing, peaceful, pure bliis.  We all felt very happy on the terrace, in the tub which was constantly heated and so easy to use, a real treat and makes the already beautiful property even more special. <br/>We felt so welcomed and on arrival and after settling in, we fell in love witht he place instantly and checked to see if there was any more time available. We saw there was another day available on the Air bnb calendar and asked if we could book the extra night through the air bnb app as the place was just so beautiful and was all confirmed so 2 nights became 3. <br/>Already hoping to find excuses to go back again haha. Amazing hosts, amazing property, amazing location. The perfect Air bnb experience. <br/>I tried to think of anything that was potentially negative for a future booker and genuinely could not find one fault, none of us could. Highly recommended and thank you so much for an amazing time! x
->The apartment  is really great and specious. The terrace and the jacuzzi are magnificent. Public transport nearby, restaurants and places for kids (farm) make this place a great choice for the stay with family.
->Your place was absolutely amazing. Your hospitality was of the highest calibre. The apartment was completely breathtaking with views all round. Everything was perfect and no problems at all occurred. Would book again in an instant. Thank you so much.
->I really enjoyed my stay at Janet's apartment! Amazing view and very close to the DLR, making it easy to go to Central London or stay locally. I would highly recommend this place and I would definitely stay here again!
->Janet's apartment was perfect for a weekend in London. It was so spacious, very clean with just the most stunning views! The hot tub was amazing, lovely and warm and really good at the end of a busy day in London. It is really well equipped, and Janet was the perfect host letting us know all about the area, where to eat etc and provided key essentials for our short time there. It's a short walk from local restaurants, and only a few minutes from the DLR to get about. We will definitely return to Janet's beautiful apartment in the future.
->Meeting Janet in her very beautiful apartment in a very beautifully appointed location was more delightful than I had anticipated. What a welcome! She apologized profusely that the pull out sofa had not yet arrived but explained the use of the couch on the mezzanine floor for our third person  (two adequate bedrooms and two bathrooms meant each person had their privacy). I slept there very comfortably, with the view of the Docklands and with immediate access to her private hot tub. Brilliant! She left us a bottle of prosecco as a sort of compensation. Sweet! Our only 'disturbance' for our trip, designed to attend the Pizza and Prosecco festival at the O2, was that the local railway (DLR) had stopped services and we were scrambling to figure out our journeys. Overall, I have to say that this host was superb and her apartment is spectacular! Brava!
->Fantastische Aussicht. In der Nähe ist ein Supermarkt und auch verschiedene Restaurants.
->We really enjoyed our stay in this apartment! Photos do not really show how beautiful and cozy it is. Mezzanine floor is amazing, and the view is just breathtaking. We had everything we needed there. Janet left us some bread, milk, butter, and even a bottle of Prosecco, which was very kind of her. Apartment is located in a very quite modern area, which was perfect for us. DLR station is just 5 min away, so you can get to the central part of the city fairly quickly. Uber from the city center cost us about £15-20. We definitely want to stay there in the future and want to thank Janet for everything! 
->Het is een ruim appartement met een super uitzicht . Heerlijke hot tube.
->The place to be <br/>i stay 3night in this penthouse and it was perfect <br/>Mention spéciale pour les français , n’hesitez Pas une seule seconde et faite de cette appartement votre pied à terre pour visiter Londres.<br/>Thank you Janet ! I hope to come Back in your penthouse bye!

->This apartment is really lovely. It was spotlessly clean and has beautiful views across London. Both bedrooms and the living room had a fan in which came in really handy in the heat! I was surprised and pleased to find lots of things in the cupboards that you might need - coffee, cooking ingredients, washing powder etc.
->Martin was a wonderful host and the apartment was great! Lovely view, sensible floor plan, cute terrace, well furnished, etc. Martin was also really kind in helping us check in early and accommodating the fact that we had a baby (he had the crib set up, for example)! Thanks Martin!

->I loved staying at Pavan's beautiful flat. It is a lovely place that is comfortable, fully equipped, bright and green with the lovely plants. It has two big bedrooms, with extremely comfortable beds and amazingly two bathrooms - all of this made for a very comfortable stay. It was a great experience from time of booking throughout, as Pavan was very kind, shared details and was available for anything I needed!
->I really enjoyed my stay at pavan's place. Very clean, great location, good size and pavan was very helpful. Thanks
->Pavan’s place is light and airy and super comfortable. He was incredibly accommodating and communicative. Whitechapel station is a short walk and there is even a small farm down the street. Whatever you do, don’t miss Rinkoffs bakery just around the corner. The sandwiches and cronuts were a perfect way to start the day!!! I would definitely recommend and stay again.
->Pavan and Emily’s place was the perfect base camp for exploring the east parts of London. The flat was bright and charming, with all the working amenities.  Pavan was also a wonderful communicator and extremely helpful!

->sehr gute Lage , in 10 Minuten an der U Bahn Station White Chapel.<br/>Die Wohnung ist sehr komfortabel und super ausgestattet, alles ist vorhanden.
->The accommodation was perfect for myself and a friend.  It was actually roomier than I expected from the photos.  It is clean and well equipped.  The situation is good, with at least two tube stations within easy walk.  Rinkoffs bakery is literally just around the corner, so we breakfasted there both mornings.  The pastries are delicious.  I’d definitely recommend staying here.

Very clean and well laid out. It had all the amenities including shower gels, towels and face cloths. Petronille also provided us with extra blankets and pillows which was very nice. Petronille also allowed me to check out at a later time which meant we really appreciated.

My friends and I had an amazing time. <br/><br/>I will definitely 100% recommend this flat to anyone looking for a nice relaxing getaway in East London.

REVIEWS:

->Dan was an amazing host and very flexible in accommodating our needs.
->Had some issues with the collection of the keys , but the host was communicating with me to resolve this issue. The actual property was very clean and felt like home for the weekend, accommodated 6 of us very well.
->Dan’s apartment was amazing! It was honestly one of the best apartments I’ve ever stayed in. Canary wharf is just around the corner, it’s a safe neighborhood and everything you need is close by. Dan was great and responded very quickly to any and all matters. It was overall a 10/10 experience.
->Stayed in the flat for 3 nights with child and dog. Very good and spacious flat, warm enough in winter period. Great location with easy commute to central London by car and DLR, which is just across the road. <br/>Easy and quick communication with the host.
->l'appartamento di Dan si trova in una posizione molto comoda. L'appartamento è confortevole, ampio e pulito. la comunicazione con Dan ed i suoi collaboratori è stata ottima.
->Nice place, check in and out is 10min far away from the place but we enjoyed our stay!

->Great apartment, convenient for Canary Wharf, very helpful host. Plenty of room, would stay again.
->Dan was a great host and was very responsive. The check-in process was a little troublesome because the key collection point is a 10minute walk away from the apartment. However, Dan was extremely accommodating and made arrangements to have the keys passed to me at the entrance of the apartment, which made things super convenient for us. Really appreciate him going  the extra mile to help make our stay comfortable!

->Great place
->Amazing place 1000/10 nice clean big nice people overall great experience
->Great place easy checkin
->Great place very central and very spacious! Would 100% return. Host has great communication
->Very nice apartment for a reasonable price :)
->Mihaly was very good at communicating and answered any questions and queries very quickly.<br/>The apartment was spacious and well equipped and in a good location to get to all the London attractions.
->Very nice location!!!!
->Clean and tidy. Good location
->Although this apartment is two floors above a street just off Brick Lane, it's really pretty quiet as Fashion Street itself is narrow with little traffic. The most we heard were the guys delivering food on bikes, who hang out next door in their breaks.<br/>We didn't like the fact that the main bathroom door doesn't fully close (though it's manageable. What we really DID appreciate was something that doesn't feature in the listing - the little outdoor seating area! The view's not great, but it was a lovely surprise to find it.<br/>We would probably go back on another trip to London.
->Very spacious place, well located, just as advertised. Also has a balcony overlooking the back of the flat.<br/>Instructions were very clear.

REVIEWS:

->The best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in! Everything was lovely and very reasonably priced! Would recommend to anyone who wants to stay around the area! Very accommodating to our needs!
->The space was great and as advertised! You have a great view of the London skyline.  The location is close to public transport (approximately 12 minute walk to the tube).  There is a lively night scene and grocer within easy walking distance on Leman Street.  It is very clean with all the essentials provided by the host.  Harriet was in constant contact with us to ensure our stay was trouble free.  We would definitely stay again on a visit to London!!
->Very good
->We were 5 adults and a baby so this was a perfect space for us. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with the wonderful view, the space, nice kitchen, nice sheets and towels, it was perfect! :) highly recommended! :)
->great location, spacious place, highly recommend it
->Lovely place to stay.  Clean, quiet and secure.  Fantastic view of the city and dock lands in the evenings.  A Short walk to the Tube or DLR station puts docklands or the city a short ride away.  Can’t really fault it.  Thanks!
->The lift is unstable. We were blocked in the lift for about 5 minutes and no door guards  nor  CCTV come to help!  It was a horrible experience.
->This apartment has a great location for sightseeing in London. It is close to three tube stations, Tower Hill, Shadwell, and Aldgate.  There are plenty of restaurants and stores with a variety of food options and price range. It has a nice view of the skyline and is located on the top floor (12).  It has plenty a room and is a 2 story apartment.  It was our first AirBnB stay and it worked well for us because we are a family of 4, two adults and 2 teenagers that need there own beds, which is better then getting two hotel rooms for the week. The host communicate quickly by email, and answer all of our questions. We rented a car our last day to visit Stonehenge and was able to park at the apartment overnight, because we got back late.  We had to arrange that ahead of time with the Concierge/doorman but it was easy. 
->Harriet’s place was totally gorgeous, it was great for our three night stay. Host was communicative and easy to reach. Ample space for our family of five. We enjoyed being on the balcony every evening with great views of the City! Very walkable to Tower of London and Tower Bridge. Eat a Cirilo’s - it was amazing food close by! <br/>As a side note: we were in London during some of their hottest days in years as they were experiencing a heatwave. The place has no AC which we knew prior to booking, but it was quite hot in London. This is no fault of the host just a fluke heatwave in Europe - and us being silly Americans used to AC! But worth noting in case you book in summer to be prepared. There are fans in the house and that was helpful during the heatwave! <br/>Overall a great place to stay!
->My family  had  a lovely one week stay at Harriet’s place. The check in experience was excellent and a pack of strawberries was provided as a welcome amenity!  Nice touch from a responsive host.The penthouse apartment is spacious, very clean with essential amenities and amazing views of the city. <br/>There is no A/C in the apartment which we knew about before booking, but Harriet provided fans and a portable cooling unit to make my family comfortable. It was about 10 minutes walk to the nearest train station and easy to order an Uber to the apartment complex. Overall, a great comfortable  stay. We will book again on another trip.
