REVIEWS:

->Nathan's apartment is spacious and clean. There are two bedrooms with double beds (although a bit small for tall Dutch people). There is a large kitchen and a good size living room. <br/>There is a little garden, at the time when we were here the landscaping was not quite finished yet.<br/>There is ample parking on the street, free of cost in the evenings and weekends.<br/>Public transport to the center of London is a bit more of a challenge. There is a train station in Loughborough and apparently a bus hub somewhere in the area but there was no info in the apartment about the connections (Nathan told us he will see to that soon).<br/>In the morning planes fly over so earplugs are a must.
->Nathan's place was a bit confusing at first from the photos. We went to the wrong house on the street however, it is the building on your right. The pictures shown were a bit misleading. The shower looks much larger in the photos, the kitchen wasn't up to my standards, and the apt looks like a quick refurbished job. You can make it work if you are there for a few days. Overall it was an ok night's rest
->Thanks Nathan. Nice clean spot. slightly difficult to find.... once we figured out the bus at the end of the Road access was much easier. <br/>Nathan left tea and coffeeand some milk for us do that was great. we were a family of 6 . Hot water for showers was great. would come again.
->Nathan was an attentive host - great communication and was quick to help with any queries.
->The place is nice and clean and the location is close to many trains and buses which I enjoyed . This place is mostly for short stays and the rooms are very spacious . The bathroom is incredibly small and the drainage is poor so you have to take quick showers. I love that the toilet and shower are in two different spots so no hogging the bathroom when you really gotta go. The sink over the toilet was weird but efficient . When I arrived we sadly had no heat and hot water, was not something you want to experience after flying in early only having to wait hours to check in. But Nathan is very responsive and fixed the issue for us  quickly and even left a bottle oh Hennessy which was very nice of him. The shower head in the bathroom was close to falling of so we were afraid to touch it and be blamed for damages …the place could use some remodeling and more art pieces on the wall to make it more homely. On Sunday their was a church or event gathering which made lots of noise in the morning but I didn’t mind because I know Africans love a celebration lol . (Just something to be wary of ) overall I enjoy the stay and enjoy Nathan’s quick fix and communication . I would most likely stay again if the prices were a little cheaper but overall I enjoyed my stay as I was mostly experiencing london . Thank you Nathan !
->Had a great stay in London. <br/>The place reflects the images in the listing well.<br/>Nathan’s flat was clean, cozy,with quick access to transport and convenience stores nearby.<br/>Communication with the host was perfect, replying almost instantly to any query.<br/>Overall, really enjoyed my time there and would definitely come back in the near future.
->Nathan was really easy to communicate with and was really helpful if we had any issues.
->Nice apartment!
->The flat was clean and had everything we needed. Great for a few days.
->Great stay for the price.  Public transportation everywhere. The place is A little outside of the sites in London, but you can get to them just fine.

->Ubicación estupenda cerca de las atracciones principales y bien comunicada tanto por metro como por bus.<br/>Limpieza y amplitud del apartamento sumado a la comodidad y que no le falta de nada, han conseguido que nos sintamos en nuestra propia casa. Cama cómoda. Baños fantásticos. Cocina equipada. Wifi funciona muy bien. Muy tranquilo para descansar por las noches. Los propietarios atentos y accesibles. Recomendaría a mis amigos y familia o cualquier persona que quiera disfrutar Londres.
->we had a great time. hosts or their team was available for every question with fast response time. location was unique 15 minutes walk from Thames, 5 min to underground yet a very quiet neighborhood.<br/>apartment itself is very spacious, bedrooms and bathroom were very big and modern. <br/>living room and rooms have big windows,  terraces enablin a lot of sun.
->This is a great flat in the city - beautifully appointed. Inflatable bed was a bit odd as it was in the master bedroom....but I would highly recommend the flat.
->Good place to stay in London 
->David and Paul’s home is beautiful and a real joy for your stay in London. Tons of nearby buses, tubes and taxis, plus an easy 30 min walk to the London Eye and the Thames. The bedrooms are spacious and the leafy outlook is super relaxing after a hard day of sightseeing. The hosts are really responsive with any queries and gave us good advise about getting around in London. Good wifi too. The stairs between the two floors of the home are quite steep and can be tough on the knees (we had all just done the West Highland Way so our knees were knackered!) but other than hat we loved our stay. Highly recommended. 
->Great stay at David's apartment. Accurate pictures and description. Bedrooms are on separate floors, which provides an additional level of privacy.  If you are looking for the freezer, the modern kitchen has it tucked away separately under the counter. For coffee drinkers the options are french press, vintage-style stovetop percolator, or instant. Air conditioners are located in each bedroom and sufficiently cooled the apartment when it was 80F outside. <br/>It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the tube. However, uber rides to Greater London were 6-10 GBP and was an easier door-to-door travel option. It's also less costly if you are traveling with a family or group. A number of restaurants, take away, and grocery options within a 5-10 minute walk. Neighborhood is residential and safe.<br/>One thing to note is that the google street view didn't match the modern look of the apartment. David's apartment can't be seen on the google street view because it's through the black gate, which opens to a nice private courtyard prior to accessing the apartment in the back.
->No service at all !!! But first class apartment at good calm location, you will find everything that you need for your stay in the apartment.<br/>One bedroom has air mattress which is comfortable though.<br/>No service is regarding an issue we faced with check in which was promised at 3:00 pm but instead it was ready by 8:00 pm only as we had to stay there for the cleaner to clean it up and our whole first day got wasted and we were provided with bath towels set 1 peice for each guest and we were promised the first day that we will be provided with new towel set 1 peice for each guest and were given the same assurance for 6 days but no towels reached out to us so the third day we bought new towels any ways.<br/>They charge about 50£ for late check out but what about late check in they should compensate too.<br/>PS :- Lovely apartment highly recommend but beware of services provided by the team.
->We had a nice stay in the appartment. <br/>Perfect location, great house!<br/>Contact with Paul was good and he helped use perfect.

->Super recomendable! Es uno de los mejores alojamientos donde he estado de Airbnb.<br/>Estaba todo limpio, nuevo.

Comunicación genial.<br/>Nos cruzamos con vecinos y eran encantadores, nos dieron indicaciones y nos ayudaron.<br/>Cerca hay supermercado y muchos restaurantes.

->Cveta heeft ons zeer warm ontvangen. Gaf een kleine rondleiding en gaf enkele tips i.v.m. Openbaar vervoer en leuke restaurantjes in de buurt.

->I️ stayed here for 6 weeks.  This place is very well equipped, as I️ wanted for nothing the entire stay. It literally looks like what you see in the photos and is as fantastic as you might imagine. Far more spacious than what I’m accustomed to encountering in London. Elephant & Castle is a short 15 minute walk which was excellent for my commute.
->Siamo stati ospiti una settimana a Natale. L'appartamento è  davvero accogliente e confortevole, molto luminoso, con ampie vetrate schermate da tende; gli spazi ben arredati e ampi, esattamente come si vede dalle foto. La cucina è  attrezzata con lavastoviglie, frigo e congelatore, abbiamo cucinato comodamente la nostra cena di Natale. La zona è tranquilla, silenziosa e comoda da raggiungere, a 10 minuti da bus e metropolitana. Ci siamo trovati davvero bene!
->Great place! Loved it!
->This is a modern, clean and beautiful one-bed apartment which had ample space for our family of four. We loved having a full kitchen and laundry for our stay, and the location was a short walk to the Elephant & Castle tube station and multiple bus options. Communication was easy and quick and Catherine was a great host. <br/>Would highly recommend this apartment and we would definitely stay there again if returning to London.
->Il n'y a pas un seul instant ou j'ai regretté ce logement. C'est un appartement magnifique, confortable et reposant. J'ai invité mes parent d'un certains âge à séjourner dans ce charmant appartement facile d'accès convient même aux personnes handicapées ou d'un certains âge comme mes parent. Catherine est d'une gentillesse extrême et répond d'une rapiditée a vos questions ce qui a facilité mes recherches. Elle sait comment recevoir ses invités et prévoir à l'avance le nécessaire pour que l'on manque de rien c'était un réel plaisir de l'avoir comme partenaire je n'ai malheureusement pas eu la chance de la rencontrer mais le monsieur qui m'a gentillement fait visiter les lieux était d'une extrême bonté. Je souhaite à chacun de vivre cette expérience surtout que nous étions qu'à 25 min en métro de picadilly circus 15 min de covent garden 10 min de marche entre la station et l'appartement seulement 2 min du bus entre le bus et l'appartement en plus nous restons en zone donc vos déplacements ne seront que plus agréable. Je garderai précieusement ses coordonnées pour un prochain retour de mes parent. Merci encore pour tout à Catherine.
->Great apartment! Great host, highly recommend!
->We really enjoyed our stay in your apartment, Catherine! Thanks a lot for your help and your super fast answers. Good neighborhood and a nice and modern apartment.<br/>Thanks again for everything. Definitely recommended!
->She is a great host!<br/>We really loved her beautiful house.<br/>My kid wanted to live there for a month.
->Our stay in this apartment was awesome, it has everything you need for a confortable stay. Hosts are great! They provide to us all the informations we need and all the answers came really quickly. I highly recommend this place!!
->Es gibt Wohnungen die man am liebsten nicht bewerten möchte - weil man Angst hat das so viele andere diese auch buchen und wenn man wieder dort hin möchte ist sie ausgebucht :).... Wer hier bucht hat eine Gastgeberin die super schnell auf Fragen antwortet- mit jeder Menge interessanten Informationen - und einer Freundlichkeit die das verreisen über Airbnb zu einem fantastischen Erlebnis macht. Ich wüsste keinen Grund wieso man, wenn man nach London reist, hier nicht übernachten sollte. 7 min zur U-Bahn Elephant & Castle, 3 min zur Bushaltestelle wo man z.B. In weiteren 10 min an der London Bridge ist. Mit der U-Bahn 10 min bis Westminster - also absolute Citylage! Die Wohnung sehr, sehr modern. Wir waren einmal Frühstücken (im Breakfastclub) - muss mal sein :) Ansonsten haben wir die Küche genutzt: da ist alles: Kühlschrank, Herd, Toaster, Geschirrspühler etc.... Frühstücken mit Blick in einen Park - einfach super. Viele sprachen davon das das Essen in London ganz schön teuer werden kann - passiert hier nicht: Supermarkt ist in der Nähe! Ansonsten großes Bad, großes Bett, schickes Wohnzimmer - alles mit Thermostate ausgestattet. Wenn wir wieder nach London reisen (und das werden wir) hoffe ich das diese Wohnung frei ist - ich wüsste nicht warum wir woanders übernachten sollten. DANKE Catherine

The kitchen is fully equipped and provided with coffee machine, tea bags and snacks.  The only problem we have is the premise is located on the 4 storey which means there are stairs to climb, so make sure you don’t have large and heavy luggages or you are strong to carried them all the way up.

->The apartment is in a good, quiet and secure location, enjoys lots of storage and is spacious. Great for a family<br/>Was not ready as at check-in time, we met the housekeeper in, had a lingering odour we had to get rid off over a couple of days, no basic condiments,even salt was available for cooking, not even tea bags was provided, only 1 handwash for both bathrooms, no air freshener etc.Kitchen appliances and most utensils old and needs replacement. Happy there was a blender though. Towels and some beddings could do with a replacement.  Communication and cleanliness is poor. Storage could use some tidying up. Otherwise, the place is ok.
->Very modern place, not too far away from Canary Warf, so ease of access to London. Would recommend for a small group of people or a family.

->Thank you very much for having us, Maaz!<br/>This was my first time staying through Airbnb and Maaz made the trip all so easy. 
->Great communication and the flat was a great location for our one night stay. 10 minute walk to the tube, felt like a safe area and the beds were comfy. The wifi however didn't work very well but we didn't really need it. 
->Home was lovely and looks likes photos. It is a quiet residential area so I had a bit of a problem playing loud music but besides that the home and host is lovely and would definitely recommend going. I would go again. The carpet is white so If going with children be cautious of this.
->Really lovely house, very clean and spacious. 
->Lovely place, great location just off the high street and very convenient to get too! A very cosy and spacious place to stay.

->Vito's flat is great. The roof top patio is great to enjoy a beer and a cigar with great views of the city. Location is convenient to great restaurants, shops and the Underground. <br/>I highly recommend Vito's flat.
->This is a cute apartment in a convenient location!
->Great location.
->This beautiful stylish spot in London is perfect to stay in, its warm and cozy and ideally located.  <br/>The layout and decor is of a high quality and it is what I would call very ‘grown up’ <br/>I enjoyed staying here and look forward to many more stays in the future, especially spring and summer when the roof terrace will be such a treat to make use of!
->Nice location, good value for the price
->Vito’s cute little space is perfectly located for all of the best things London has to offer. We had a wonderful stay over Christmas.
->The location is excellent, close to restaurants, shopping area and tube station. Check-in was very efficient and the apartment was extremely clean. You find everything you need. The terrace is beautiful and must be great during the summer. Highly recommended.
->vito's location was excellent.  The room was very clean and everything was ready.  There was a problem, but vito responded quickly.  Highly recommended
->If you’re looking for a place that is close to the underground tube station (Bond Street station), shopping stores (Oxford St), eateries and grocery store, this is the one! Vito’s flat is just about 5 mins walk to the nearest tube station (Bond Street) and the famous Oxford St (for shopping). Many food options around the area and grocery store is within a short walk. Check in/out was easy. Vito also has a guide book in his flat that was helpful. <br/>The flat was equipped with all that we needed for the stay except for one thing - unfortunately, the shower water heater wasn’t working properly. It started out with very very hot temperature and then just icy cold water. It was uncomfortable. Vito kindly arranged for a plumber to take a look at it however, the plumber did not show up on time, twice. Waited for an hour later on the second time and the plumber managed to do a temporary solve, no more icy cold water - just very hot  which we had to make do. Though this isn’t directly on the host, we appreciate his help and hope it gets fixed for the next guest. Aside from this situation, this place is still an ideal Airbnb.
->My family and I had an excellent stay at Vito’s apartment; lovely place- small and cosy and at a wonderful location. The place is just off oxford street with fantastic access to anywhere in London really and Vito is a great host. Would definitely stay here again.

->The flat is in a pleasant neighborhood and well connected to the centre thanks to the bus service. The house is very clean and tidy, the view from the leaving room is incredible. Philippa has been really nice offering the complete usage of her kitchen and also very kind leaving flexibility in checking out time.<br/>
->I had a great stay in London at Philippa's home. The apartment is great and is very easy to get to the city by bus. <br/>Would recommend to everyone to stay there!
->We had a very pleasant stay with Lachlan, he made us feel welcome from the very fist moment. The place was exactly as described, private  bathroom is a big plus. Everybody who is looking for stay well connected to public transportation, bus stop (to Victoria) is right next to the building, this is the place to go ;)
->Pip and Lachlan were amazing hosts who made us feel very welcome in their home. The views from the lounge are gorgeous and the house is very clean and tidy. We would definitely stay with them again when we return to Battersea.
->We thought Phillippa was a very nice host. I liked that they were so flexible about check in and out and also that they were easy to communicate with. Also, they made us feel very welcome as they had print out some good information about restaurants, busstops and other things nearby. She also gave us some tips about what to do in London. <br/><br/>The room was clean and it was so nice to have a private bathroom. 
->Philippa and her boyfriend are awesome hosts. From the very first minute we felt very comfortable and homey. The place by itself is central, the bus stop is right in front of the house. There are restaurants and supermarkets in walking distance. Moreover, the place was exactly as it is discribed. The view from the living room, their hospitality and the private bathroom make this place special. Communication was perfect and both of them are very flexible in regard of checking in and out times. Definitly would stay with them again!!!
->Great location with very easy access to bus and train.  The apartment is super nice, hosts were friendly and provided a lot of helpful info and suggestions.

->Staying with Philippa and Lachlan was an absolute joy. The apartment was easy to find and has excellent easy connections to Central London; about 20 minutes by the bus right out front. The view from their kitchen is worth the stay, as are the private bathroom and cozy accommodations. They really make you feel like their home is your own. They were really kind and helpful hosts and even went out of their way to help us when we accidentally left something behind. It was one of the best Airbnb experiences I've had. Highly recommended. 
->Philippa and Lachlan are really accomodating and friendly. My parents stayed in Philippa's place and despite they can't speak english, hostes were really kind. The apartment is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!Quite clean in every part of it, with a big and private bathroom!But the very best thing is the astonishing view on the Thames!!Thank you Philippa and Lachlan!!

->Lovely flat, quiet & calm.. nice balcony.. had a nice relaxing stay
->A lovely, charming, place to stay. The balcony was a big plus - a real suntrap.  And the communication was 100%.  A big thanks goes to Erika for making it a great Easter.
->We had a brilliant stay in this apartment, very cool vibe and super clean! Very close to lots of great bars and places to eat. Very secure and easy to access, total privacy and the check in/out process was easy!<br/>Highly recommend!
->I stayed at Erika’s beautiful apartment while I was down in London for work. Connection to tube and buses was excellent - you’re a stones throw from Manor House tube. I was actually driving this time and was able to park for free on the street as I was home after 6.30pm and left before 8am each morning. It was so great to stay somewhere comfortable and stylish instead of a boring hotel room. I’ll definitely be back!
->Erika’s flat is extremely comfortably and well-decorated. It’s mere footsteps to the nearest tube station, but the side street it is on is very quiet. The balcony is a wonderful place to sip a glass of wine at the end of the day and enjoy views of the nearby park.
->Fantastic flat in a great location, Erika was a caring host from beginning to end. Highly recommend  staying here for anyone looking to take a trip to London. <br/>15 minute tube ride from Piccadilly circus, a mini supermarket a 5 minute walk away, and great amenities in the flat.
->Erika has been very responsive throughout our stay whenever we have questions. Her place is beautifully decorated, with a spacious terrace where we enjoyed spending a lot of time on. The flat is also well located near the tube station with a supermarket nearby.
->Loved my stay! Was conveniently located right next to the underground. Easy to get around. Was decorated beautifully and just as pictured!
->Erika was a wonderful host who was great at communicating with me every step of the way. The flat is close to the tube station and also to a wonderful breakfast spot called the Dobar Project which I highly recommend. The apartment was incredibly comfortable, stylishly decorated, and furnished with all the amenities you could need. highly recommend staying here!

->We had a great time staying here for 1 week. We loved the place as it was, as advertised, very clean and tidy as well as being in a great location in central London. The bed was very comfotable, the couch was great, the kitchen facilities were perfect and it seemed that the bathroom and the bathtub were newly renovated, very clean and nice. The apartment is on the top floor of the apartment which was great because it could let the daylight in due to the little windows on the ceiling both in the bedroom and the bathroom. The only downside may be that there is no lift for someone who is not prepared to carry luggages up and down but i think that there is a small price to pay for the location it is in. The apartment is spacious enough for 2 people for sure and friends can crash over at the sofa bed comfortably if privacy is not too much of a concern. Vito was a great host, he arranged everything very smoothly for our stay, kept in touch when we needed him and had someone professional to greet us when we arrived to show us the apartment and answer any questions we might have had. We are sure to stay here again when we re-visit London!
->Great space, comfortable in a very convenient locale just north of Oxford Street. Easily accessible from Heathrow and to all  main tourist attractions. Fantastically comfortable bed, not so comfortable pull out sofa bed.  Shower was luxurious! <br/>We were a late check in (9pm) and only after we had accepted booking were we told we would have to pay a £25 late check in fee. Also upon check in, we were told that there was a problem with the oven, we could use either the cooktop or the oven but not both at the same time- the lovely lady that checked us in advised us that this was going to be fixed the day after we left.  It was difficult to move luggage up to and from the third floor ( maybe 60 stairs), but that being said it was advertised as such. <br/>Communication was prompt and efficient with with Vito and the ladies that orchestrated check in. I only wish the weather had been more conducive to enjoy the lovely rooftop deck...maybe next time. 
->Great location, bars, restaurants, all types of shops, tube & bus very near.  The flat (gorgeous deco), great roof terrace, everything had been thought through to make our stay ideal. Full of nice attentions: hairdryer, coffee & tea, soap & shampoo, 2 mobiles for local use, etc ... Feeling of being at a friend's place.<br/>The (best Italian) landlord and the welcoming team are  very nice and helpful. Excellent stay, we strongly recommend.
->Vito's place is truly a gem! It is exactly as portrayed in the photos and description of the apartment. Loved the contemporary look of the apartment and it felt very bright and airy with all its skylight. The place was fully equipped, very clean and quiet, though situated on a street with lots of lovely shops, restaurants and all conveniences. Having lived in London before, I would say Vito's place is unbeatable in terms of location. It is exactly as he described it to be,close to all major sites and transportation. Round the block from his place is Manchester Sq, which is lovely and The Wallace collection is right there. Vito himself is a wonderful host, very helpful and prompt with replies from beginning till the end our stay. His staff was professional and was there waiting for us when we arrived. Everything went very smoothly and we would definitely recommend his place and would love to stay again. And he feels like a friend !!
->Vito and Anita (the property manager) are really involved, helpful and effective. The flat is well designed with a lot things (TV, WiFi, 2 mobile phones...) and a real kitchen. <br/>The location is great, close to Bond Street station. <br/>
->A lovely little space with everything you could want at your doorstep.  The roof deck was lovely even though it was too cold to use it and the concierge service was spot on.  The flat was tidy and clean, the bed was comfy and there were no problems or issues.
->Host and his team are easy to communicate with, and are clear & straightforward from the moment you message them.  Apartment itself is fine, most of it's value arises from the fact that it is in a great location, close to many restaurants, parks, shopping, and public transportation.
->Vito is a gracious host<br/>I used to live in London so I know it well and this flat i s in the best location. Well equipped, beautifully done up and perfectly located, but it's the roof terrace that really does it. Overlooking the heart of Marylebone village, I had great weather and enjoyed it from the terrace looking out at the neighbourhood.<br/>The intercom wasn't working so if you're hosting like me it's a tiny bit of a hassle to run down the stairs to let guests in. Apart from that this flat is fawless and really lives up to it's billing as a true gem in the heart of London. <br/>I look forward to visiting again.
->Fantastic host with a beautiful Apartment.<br/><br/>I have had over 4 different stays in London with different Airbnb hosts/locations but I would have to say that Vito and his apartment is my favourite out of all of them.<br/><br/>I will definitely reserve the apartment for my next stay in London.
->Hermoso departamento. Excelente ubicación en una zona ideal para enamorarse de Londres. <br/>Vitto y su equipo ofrecen todo lo necesario para tener una estadía placentera en el departamento. Lo recomiendo un 100%!!!

->Absolutely loved staying in Toms apartment. It was perfect with a beautiful view! I can't recommend it enough and would definitely love to stay again. It was easy to find and we managed to park across the road for free which was a bonus. I can't thank Tom enough as he made it extra special as it was my birthday!  
->Tom flat is simply stunning! great size, beautifully decorated and a breath taking view. Tom's email communication was quick, informative and relaxed. Although he wasn't around when we arrived, we were meet by a friend of his who was very helpful. Eggs and fresh bread were kindly provided which was a nice touch. The whole place was also immaculately clean.<br/><br/>I'd definitely stay here again and can thoroughly give my vote of confidence in Tom as a host.
->Apartment was beautiful and bright. Tom was super helpful. Would recommend highly. Near lots of lobelia Vietnamese restaurants and brilliant local pub on the corner. TOP MARKS TOM!
->Best Air BnB hosts I've had! Very welcoming and easy to contact. Would absolutely use again if in the area. Gorgeous flat in a great location on a quiet road but not far from shops and the tube.
->We arrived in London slightly delayed but Tom's sister waited for us and was really friendly as she showed us around. The neighborhood is lively and fun. The apartment is lovely. Although Tom was not there, the house was full of touches that made us feel very welcome. The bedrooms are comfortable and the bathroom is clean and modern. 
->We had a great stay at Tom's flat, communication about logistics was very friendly and quick. The photos almost don't do the flat justice, it really is very spacious and stylish, and quiet to boot. 
->Great flat! Nice, spacious, worked well for our family of three. Very easy access to busses and trains.  
->Flat was great, everything we wanted and more! Contact with both Tom and Debbie (Toms mum) when Tom was on holiday was fantastic. Very helpful in all aspects as we had to change our plans last minute, which did not pose a problem and we felt that we were accommodates very well. <br/>Would highly  recommend this apartment

->This is great little apartment for those wanting to be super close to the city. Everything is just a few short stops away. Cathrina was a great host, who showed an immense kindness to all of us. You will most definitely be made to feel welcome :) A nice little surprise for us was the Yurt cafe, literally next door in the St Kathrine’s community garden. We made it a point to start our day there every morning, a charming little oasis amidst all the hustle and bustle.
->The location is really great in that it’s literally right in front of the subway & bus station (limehouse), which is also like 10 min from central London! Also there are 2 grocery stores really close by which was really convenient. <br/>One small discomfort was that the elevator was being fixed during our stay (still has about a month left til complete) so it was a little tiring checking in and out with all our big luggages. <br/>However, other than that it was overall a great experience!
->O check in foi excelente, com uma ótima recepção. O elevador estava quebrado e a Katrina até ajudou a subir as escadas com as malas. O elevador permaneceu quebrado por umas 2 semanas e a limpeza das áreas comuns não é das melhores. No final tivemos alguns problemas, o banheiro apresentou um vazamento e o exaustor parou de funcionar, e embora seja evidente que o vazamento tivesse um remendo antigo, ela insiste em jogar a responsabilidade pelo conserto em mim, está postura é muito desagradável, pois fiz o uso consciente e responsável da acomodação, mas recebi uma cobrança de algo que é evidentemente de responsabilidade do proprietário da acomodação. No mais, o apartamento fica em frente a uma estação DLR é pequena, mas confortável embora o elevador e o banheiro tenham apresentado problemas durante a estadia.
->Cathrina is the nicest and kindest host I've ever met, she suggested us so many things and places and was always ready to help us. The apartment is literally 30 sec away form the DLR so the positions is great. We had a good time there, some spaces are a little bit small (the bathroom and one bedroom) and hot, but the apartment is in general quite big and well cleaned. Nearby there is everything you need for your stay: supermarkets, restaurants, pubs,... really close to the city centre!
->Fomos muito bem recebidos pela Cathrina. Local muito aconchegante e de fácil acesso ao transporte público, em frente ao DLR.<br/> Para quem gosta de caminhar, dá para ir a Tower Bridge a pé.<br/>Nas proximidades do alojamento tem muito comércio.<br/> Fizemos um  belo passeio às margens do rio próximo ao alojamento. Recomendamos muito que se hospedem com a Cathrina.
->Super nice host. Everybody were happy with the stay.
->E' stato un soggiorno molto piacevole, ottima posizione, casa molto carina, pulita ed accogliente.  Cathrina molto gentile e piacevole, ottimo servizio di accoglienza! i suoi consigli sono stati molto apprezzati ed utili. <br/>Alcune note negative: difficoltà di comunicazione con l'host che raramente ha risposto ai messaggi ed infine purtroppo valuto negativamente l'insistente richiesta di rimborso di un adattatore che noi non abbiamo mai visto ne usato. Oneroso ed ingiustificato rimborso che ha ottenuto, per iniziale fraintendimento, nonostante non fosse nostra responsabilità
->We had a great stay. Cathrina was very helpful, friendly and welcoming. Great and clean space, easy to get to all the big places. All in all a great experience!
->Apartment location is great, right in front of subway station and bus stops nearby. <br/>The space is clean and good for two couples, is exactely as shown on the pictures. <br/>Many towels were provided and even an welcome gift with chocolate, cookies, tea and milk!<br/>Cathrina was very nice, communicative and helpful to provide us all information needed.<br/>Would definitely stay there again!
->Fantastic stay. <br/>The apartment is less than a minute walk to the DLR station, makes it very easy getting to the city and Canary Wharf.<br/>Apartment is clean and has all necessary amenities. <br/>Limehouse basin is a lovely area and the Regent canal is a lovely place for a walk/cycle starting just minutes from the apartment.<br/>Host gave great advice on the local area and places to visit.<br/>Would highly recommend.

->Very convenient place to stay for me, with it only being 10 mins walk to where I was working, also great access to central London from Seven Sisters. Very nice kitchen facilities and great wifi. Overall a really good experience.   
->Great stay thank you 
->Agréable séjour chez Antonia. A 10 mn de la station de métro Seven Sisters. Des épiceries à proximité et un Tesco à 15mn. L'appartement était convenable pour nous et nos 2 enfants, conforme à l'annonce Airbnb.
->This place is great if you want to be able to go into town relatively easily. The nearest tube is on the Victoria line and runs all weekend. There are lots of little shops. If you are driving, make sure you talk to the host about parking permits before you arrive. Parking permits are required from 8am - 6:30pm Monday through Saturday. The host is super responsive and overall our stay was great. 
->Thank you! It was a good start for a family to start their new life in England. Communication was great, beds are good and the kitchen is lovely. Thank you!
->Home clean and spacious; accessories avalaibility.<br/>Near parking, cheap and convenient
->If you're thinking of exploring north London, Antonia's house is a wonderful place to do it from. The house itself has had a modern renovation inside, so all the facilities and fittings are new and very clean. The host - Antonia - is in close communication to make sure everything is ok when you arrive. There is also a bowl of fruit provided which was most welcome. Transport to central London is only a 10 min walk to Seven Sisters underground station or buses. Overall, it was wonderful staying here and couldn't recommend it more. 
->Cosy house in a quiet suburban street, 5 -10 minutes walk from Underground station on Victoria line . Freshly renovated , two bedroom townhouse with kitchen and laundry. All you need to have a nice stay is there. Also it's close to large Tesco store and there are many eateries and little corner stores in the area.
->Great host and stay.
